One way your component can react to property changes is to compute values based on the new and existing property values.

If you need to compute a value to render, you can compute it in the `render()` method itself. However a more general solution is to compute values in the `willUpdate()` callback. This has a couple of advantages:

-   You can make computed properties available to [reactive controllers](/docs/composition/controllers/). The `willUpdate()` callback is called before the `hostUpdate()` callback is called on any [reactive controllers](/docs/composition/controllers/).

-   If you subclass the component, you can supply a new `render()` method and still use  the computed properties.

Updating a reactive property during `willUpdate()` does not trigger a new update cycle.
