How does a reactive property work? When you add a reactive property, Lit adds accessors for that property. When you set the property, Lit checks to see if the property has changed. If the property has changed, Lit starts an update cycle.

By default, Lit uses a strict equality check to determine whether a property has changed. If you mutate an existing array, Lit won't detect a change. Try clicking the "x" button next to one of the list items in the preview pane. You'll notice the list doesn't update.

One way around this is to treat the array as immutable. Always create a new array for every change. Try replacing the existing `splice()` call with the following line:

```ts
    this.groceries = [...this.groceries.slice(0, i), ...this.groceries.slice(i+1)];
```

Since `groceries` is now a new array, the change triggers an update.

You can also trigger an update manually, using the `requestUpdate()` lifecycle method. Try replacing the code you just added with these two lines:

```ts
    this.groceries.splice(i, 1);
    this.requestUpdate();
```

You can call `requestUpdate()` like this—with no arguments—any time you want the component to re-render. Lit's generated setter uses `requestUpdate()` under the hood.
