Setting a reactive property or calling `requestUpdate()` triggers a reactive update cycle. At the beginning of an update cycle, Lit calls the `shouldUpdate()` method, passing in a map of changed properties.

By default, `shouldUpdate()` always returns `true`. You can override `shouldUpdate()` to determine whether the component needs to update itself.

For example, take the component on the right. The component is supposed to update whenever you press the **Animate** button. But as you can see from the render counter, it also updates when you change the animation speed from **Fast** to **Slow** ... Even though there's no visual change.

To fix this, add the following method to the component class:

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
  shouldUpdate(changedProperties: PropertyValues<this>): boolean {
    return !(changedProperties.size === 1 && changedProperties.has('duration'));
  }
```

```js
  shouldUpdate(changedProperties) {
    return !(changedProperties.size === 1 && changedProperties.has('duration'));
  }
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Try changing the animation speed and watch the render count.
