Setting a reactive property or calling `requestUpdate()` triggers a reactive update cycle. The update cycle is _asynchronous_, so that updating several properties in the course of a single event handler, for example, only triggers a single update.

At the beginning of an update cycle, Lit calls the `shouldUpdate()` method, passing in a map of changed properties.

You can override `shouldUpdate()` to determine whether the component needs to update itself.

For example, take the component on the right. The component is supposed to update whenever you press the **Animate** button. But as you can see from the render counter, it also updates when you change the animation speed from **Fast** to **Slow** ... Even though there's no visual change.

To fix this, add the following method to the component class:

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
  shouldUpdate(props: PropertyValues<this>): boolean {
    return props.has('big');
  }
```

```js
  shouldUpdate(props) {
    return props.has('big');
  }
```


{% endswitchable-sample %}

Try changing the animation speed and watch the render count.
