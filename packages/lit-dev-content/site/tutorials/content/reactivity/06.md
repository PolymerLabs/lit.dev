Congratulations! That's the end of this tutorial. You learned:

*   How reactive properties trigger the reactive update cycle.
*   How to trigger an update manually.
*   How to control when the component updates.
*   How to compute values during the update.
*   How to run code after the update completes.


## Next steps

Now that you're a little more familiar with reactive properties and the reactive update cycle, you might want to try one of these tutorials:

*   [Working with lists](/tutorials/working-with-lists/). Learn the finer points
    of using repeating templates in Lit.
*   [Custom attribute converters](/tutorials/custom-attribute-converter/). Lit can
    convert a few types of attribute values (like numbers and booleans) automatically. For more complex types, you can write your own converter.
