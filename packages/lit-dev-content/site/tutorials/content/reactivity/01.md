Fundamentally, a reactive property is just a property that triggers the component to update whenever the property's value changes.

The sample on the right includes a property, `result`, but it isn't reactive. Pressing the button changes the property value, but the component never changes its display.

To make it a reactive property, add the following code to the beginning of the class.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
  @property()
```

```js
  static properties = {
    result: {},
  };
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}
