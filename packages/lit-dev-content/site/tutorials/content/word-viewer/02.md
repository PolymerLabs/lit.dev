By the end of this step, you'll be able to set an attribute `words` on your
`word-viewer`, which Lit will set to a property on your `WordViewer` class.

`<word-viewer words="ðŸ‘‹.from.html"></word-viewer>`

This can be achieved with a Lit feature called [_Reactive
Properties_](/docs/components/properties/). Define a reactive property `words`:

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
class WordViewer extends LitElement {
  @property() words = 'initial value';
  ...
}
```

```js
class WordViewer extends LitElement {
  static properties = {
    words: {},
  };

  constructor() {
    super();
    this.words = 'initial value';
  }
  ...
}
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Lit Reactive Properties are special properties that can interact with Lit's
render [lifecycle](/docs/components/lifecycle/). If the reactive property
`words` changes, the component schedules an update. By default, Lit sets up
attribute synchronization for the property and will update the property when the
attribute changes.

You should now see `initial value` in the preview.

Before moving on, change to the `index.html` file and set `words` from an
attribute.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<word-viewer words="ðŸ‘‹.from.html"></word-viewer>
```

The preview should now show `ðŸ‘‹.from.html`.

Debugging Custom Elements is awesome!

Custom Elements are like any other HTML Element, so your browser's development
tools already understand how to handle them!

Change the `words` attribute in your browser's developer tools and note that the
component reacts to the change.
