By the end of this step, you'll render one single word from the `words`
property, based on some internal reactive state in our component.

[_Internal reactive
state_](/docs/components/properties/#internal-reactive-state) refers to reactive
properties that are not part of the component's public API, therefore don't have
an associated attribute.

Define `idx`, an internal state property that will track which word is shown.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
// word-viewer.ts
class WordViewer extends LitElement {
  @state() private idx = 0;
  ...
}
```

```js
// word-viewer.js
  static properties = {
    idx: {state: true},
    ...
  };

  constructor() {
    ...
    this.idx = 0;
  }
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Then in the `render` method split the words by the `'.'` separator, and show the
word at the array index of `idx % splitWords.length`. The `%` operator will keep
the resulting index in the bounds of the `splitWords` array.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
// word-viewer.ts

  render() {
    const splitWords = this.words.split('.');
    const word = splitWords[this.idx % splitWords.length];
    return html`<pre>${word}</pre>`;
  }

```

```js
// word-viewer.js

  render() {
    const splitWords = this.words.split('.');
    const word = splitWords[this.idx % splitWords.length];
    return html`<pre>${word}</pre>`;
  }

```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

The preview should show `ðŸ‘‹`.
