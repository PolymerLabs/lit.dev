The tooltip is fully functional now, but its display is a little hard to notice.
You can address this by adding some animation for the show and hide states.
There are many ways to animate elements, but in this case a
[css transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)
should suffice.

One easy way to style element states like "showing" is to add an
attribute which corresponds to the state. To do this, add a showing property
that reflects to the attribute when set:

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
@property({reflect: true, type: Boolean})
showing = false;
```

```js
static properties = {
  offset: {type: Number},
  showing: {reflect: true, type: Boolean},
};
constructor() {
  super();
  this.offset = 4;
  this.showing = false;
}
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Now add css for the transition animation. Set the `opacity` and `scale` of
the element when its showing. This will transition over the specified duration.
Feel free to experiment with other properties that can [transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions).

```css
:host {
  /* ... */
  opacity: 0;
  transform: scale(0.75);
  transition: opacity, transform;
  transition-duration:  0.33s;
}

:host([showing]) {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: scale(1);
}
```

Now, inside the `show` method, set `showing`:

```ts
show = () => {
  // ...
  this.showing = true;
};
```

In the `hide` method, remove the code setting `display` to `none` since
that will now be done at the end of the transition. Just set `showing` to
`false` here to trigger the transition. Then add a `finishHide` method which
sets the `display` to `none` when the transition completes and `showing` is
`false`.

```ts
hide = () => {
  this.showing = false;
};

finishHide = () => {
  if (!this.showing) {
    this.style.display = 'none';
  }
};
```

The browser sends a `transitionEnd` event when a transition is done. Hook that
up to finish hiding the tooltip. This is one time work you can do in the
element `constructor`. Near the top of the class definition, add:

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
constructor() {
  super();
  // Finish hiding at end of animation
  this.addEventListener('transitionend', this.finishHide);
}
```

```js
constructor() {
  super();
  // Finish hiding at end of animation
  this.addEventListener('transitionend', this.finishHide);
  this.offset = 4;
  this.showing = false;
}
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Now move your pointer over the tooltip targets. You should see the tooltips
transitioning as they are shown and hidden.
