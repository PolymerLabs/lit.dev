The tooltip is fully functional now, but its display is a little hard to notice.
You can address this by adding some animation for the show and hide states.

There are many ways to animate elements but in this case we can use a simple
[css transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)
when the tooltip is shown and hidden.

One easy way to style element states like the "showing" state is to add an
attribute which corresponds to the state. To do this, add a showing property
that reflects to an attribute when set like this:

```ts
@property({reflect: true, type: Boolean})
showing = false;
```

Now add some styling for the css transition animation. Set the `opacity`
and `scale` of the element when its showing. This will transition over
the specified duration.

```css
:host {
  /* ... */
  opacity: 0;
  transform: scale(0.5);
  transition: opacity, transform;
  transition-duration:  0.33s;
}

:host([showing]) {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: scale(1);
}
```

Now, inside the `show` methods, set `showing`:

```ts
show = () => {
  // ...
  this.showing = true;
}
```

For the `hide` method, you'll remove the code setting `display` to `none` since
that will now be done at the end of the transition and just set `showing`. Then
add a `finishHide` method which sets the display when `showing` is `false`.

```ts
hide = () => {
  this.showing = false;
}

finishHide = () => {
  if (!this.showing) {
    this.style.display = 'none';
  }
}
```

The browser sends a `transitionEnd` event when a transition is done. Hook that
up to finish hiding the tooltip. This is one time work you can do in the
element `constructor`. Near the top of the class definition, add:

```ts
constructor() {
  super();
  // Finish hiding at end of animation
  this.addEventListener('transitionend', this.finishHide);
}
```

Now move your pointer over the tooltip targets. The tooltips should scale and
fade in and out.
