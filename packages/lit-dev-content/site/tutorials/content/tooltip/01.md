Now you'll get started building the `simple-tooltip` element by adding some
simple styling.

Here the `simple-tooltip` is being used in the `my-content`. Since the tooltip
content are the `children` of the element, it just renders a `slot` element
in its `shadowRoot`. The tooltip is showing up by default which isn't correct,
but it does make it easier to add some simple styling so you'll do that first.

To style the tooltip, add the following properties to the `:host` selector.

```css
:host {
  display: inline-block;
  position: fixed;
  padding: 4px;
  border: 1px solid darkgray;
  border-radius: 4px;
  background: #ccc;
}
```

It's common to make an element themeable by exposing css custom properties
and/or `parts`. However, in this case the tooltip user can just style the
tooltip element directly, and this will override the properties you're setting
via `:host`, which will effectively act like defaults.

The tooltip should be shown on top of the content it's hinting. This can
be notoriously difficult in css, but using `position: fixed`
creates a new [stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context)
which is very simple and should work fine for the vast
majority of cases.
