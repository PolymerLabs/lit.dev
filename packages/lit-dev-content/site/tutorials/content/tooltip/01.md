The `simple-tooltip` is used in the `my-content` element. Since the
content is just the element `children`, the tooltip renders a `slot`
in its `shadowRoot`. The tooltip is displayed by default which isn't correct,
but this makes it easier to add styling. To style the tooltip element itself,
add the following properties to the `:host` selector of `simple-tooltip`.

### simple-tooltip.<ts-js></ts-js>

```css
:host {
  display: inline-block;
  position: fixed;
  padding: 4px;
  border: 1px solid darkgray;
  border-radius: 4px;
  background: #ccc;
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

  [styling](/docs/components/styles/#shadow-dom), and the
  [`:host`](/docs/components/styles/#host) selector in the Lit
  documentation.

The tooltip should be shown on top of the content it's hinting. Using `position: fixed`
creates a new
[stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context)
which should work fine for the majority of cases.
