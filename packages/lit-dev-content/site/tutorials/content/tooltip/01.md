Get started building the `simple-tooltip` element by adding some simple styling.

The `simple-tooltip` is being used in the `my-content` element. Since the
content is just the element `children`, the tooltip renders a `slot`
in its `shadowRoot`. The tooltip is displayed by default which isn't correct,
but this makes it easier to add styling. To style the tooltip, add the
following properties to the `:host` selector.

```css
:host {
  display: inline-block;
  position: fixed;
  padding: 4px;
  border: 1px solid darkgray;
  border-radius: 4px;
  background: #ccc;
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

It's common to make an element [themeable](https://lit.dev/docs/components/styles/?mods=gists#theming)
by exposing css custom properties and/or `parts`. However, in this case the
tooltip user can just style the tooltip element directly, and this will
override the properties set via `:host`, which effectively act like defaults.

The tooltip should be shown on top of the content it's hinting. This can
be notoriously difficult in css, but using `position: fixed`
creates a new [stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context)
which should work fine for the vast majority of cases.
