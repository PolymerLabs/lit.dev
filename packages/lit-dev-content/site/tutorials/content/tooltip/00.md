In this tutorial, you'll build a simple tooltip element that supports lazy
creation, ensuring fast initial page rendering.

Tooltips are a great way to show supporting information that provides context
for the main content and interface. For example, a button might have a tooltip
showing what happens when you click it, or an icon might have a tooltip that
displays an info card.

Since tooltip content is not displayed by default and requires an interaction to
render, it's a good candidate for render optimization. By creating the
tooltip lazily when needed, you can make sure to keep initial page rendering
as fast as possible.

Here's a preview of the `simple-tooltip` element. Take a look at the
`my-content.ts` in the code editor. This shows one way to use `simple-tooltip`.
Look at the preview output and move your pointer over the interface to see how
the tooltip is displayed. Now you'll get started building the element:

* First, you'll focus on the basics: trigger the tooltip and positioning it.
* Then you'll animate the tooltip when it's shown and hidden.
* Next, you'll focus on performance by creating the tooltip lazily based on
user interaction.
* Finally, you'll create a Lit directive to declaratively create
high performance, lazy tooltips.
