In this tutorial, you'll build a simple tooltip element that supports lazy
creation, ensuring fast initial page rendering.

## Background

Tooltips are a great way to show hints that provide context for the main
content and interface. For example, a button might have a tooltip
showing what happens when you click it, or an icon might have a tooltip that
displays an info card.

Since tooltips are not displayed by default and require an interaction to
render, they are a good candidate for render optimization. By creating the
tooltip lazily when needed, you can make sure to keep initial page rendering
as fast as possible.

## Preview

Here's a preview of the `simple-tooltip` element. Take a look at
<code>my-content.<ts-js></ts-js></code> in the code editor. This shows one way
to use `simple-tooltip`. Look at the preview output and move your pointer over
the interface to see how the tooltip is displayed.

## Tasks

Here's what you'll do in the upcoming steps:

* Focus on the basics: triggering the tooltip and positioning it.
* Animate the tooltip when it's shown and hidden.
* Ensure great performance by creating the tooltip lazily based on
user interaction.
* Create a Lit directive to declaratively create high performance, lazy tooltips.

You're going to be a tooltip expert!
