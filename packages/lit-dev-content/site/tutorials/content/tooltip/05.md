Tooltip positioning seems ok now, but it's easy to get them to run
off the screen if the target element is near an edge.
Positioning tooltips robustly is fairly tricky since you need to consider not
only the layout metrics of target element but also those of the browser window
and the tooltip itself.

Luckily, there's a small library focused just on solving this problem called
[floating-ui](https://floating-ui.com/). To use it, first import the API
you'll need:

```ts
import {
  computePosition,
  autoPlacement,
  offset,
  shift
} from '@floating-ui/dom';
```

Now replace the positioning code with the `floating-ui` library code.
The library API needs the target element, the tooltip element and has a bunch
of options for how to setup positioning. It provides the `x, y` position for
the tooltip via a `Promise`.

```ts
show = () => {
  this.style.display = '';
  // Robust positioning
  computePosition(this.target, this, {
    strategy: 'fixed',
    middleware: [
      offset(this.offset),
      shift(),
      autoPlacement({allowedPlacements: ['top', 'bottom']})
    ],
  }).then(({x, y}: {x: number, y: number}) => {
    this.style.left = `${x}px`;
    this.style.top = `${y}px`;
  });
}
```

Now move your pointer over the box labeled "3" when it is near the bottom of
the preview window. Its tooltip should be displayed above the box if there's
more room for it there.
