The tooltip should be initially hidden and displayed only when the user
interacts with the element it's hinting. Add the `show` and `hide` methods so
they can be called to manage the display of the tooltip. The best way to
enforce the hidden styling is to use an inline style, because that has the
highest precedence in css.

```ts
show = () => {
  this.style.cssText = '';
};

hide = () => {
  this.style.display = 'none';
};
```

{% aside  "info" %}

The `show` and `hide` methods are defined using
[arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions).

This binds the functions to the element and makes it simpler to use them
with `add/removeEventListener` which you'll do next.

To ensure the tooltip is initially hidden, call the `hide` method in
`connectedCallback`. This standard custom element lifecycle callback is run when
the element is connected to the DOM.

```ts
connectedCallback() {
  super.connectedCallback();
  this.hide();
}
```

{% aside  "positive" %}

Call `super.connectedCallback()` in `connectedCallback`.

It's important to call `super.connectedCallback()` to preserve `LitElement`'s
default implementation.

The tooltips should now be hidden.
