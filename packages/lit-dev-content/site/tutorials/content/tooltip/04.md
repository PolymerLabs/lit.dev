Now the tooltip is being displayed correctly, based on user interactivity, but
it's not positioned in a good spot. You can see this most clearly by moving
your pointer over the right-most box.

The tooltip should be near the target element and to  allow some control over
this, first create an `offset` property inside the class definition:

```ts
// Position offset
@property({type: Number})
offset = 4;
```

Since the target element's position may change, position the tooltip
each time its shown. Again, to do this simply and robustly, use inline styling.
The `getBoundingClientRect` API can provide the layout metrics of the target
element.

```ts
show = () => {
  // ...
  // Position the tooltip near the target.
  const {x, y, height} = this.target!.getBoundingClientRect();
  this.style.left = `${x}px`;
  this.style.top = `${y + height + this.offset}px`;
}
```

After adding the code, try triggering the tooltips and notice that they are
better aligned, showing below the target elements.
