The tooltip supports good performance via lazy creation, but using the
`lazy` API is cumbersome. In addition, as implemented, the tooltip content
doesn't update when the greeted person's name changes.

A Lit directive can address these issues by encapsulating the tooltip's `lazy`
API. Users of the directive will use an
[element expression](http://lit.dev/docs/templates/expressions/#element-expressions)
on the target element and provide a
[TemplateResult](http://lit.dev/docs/libraries/standalone-templates/#rendering-lit-html-templates)
containing the tooltip content.

A scaffold for the directive is setup for you to fill in with the `update`
method already completed. It stores directive `part` and the `tooltipContent`
passed in so you can use them in the methods you'll add: `setupLazy` and
`renderTooltipContent`.

```ts
update(part: ElementPart, [tooltipContent]: DirectiveParameters<this>) {
  this.tooltipContent = tooltipContent;
  this.part = part;
  if (!this.didSetupLazy) {
    this.setupLazy();
  }
  if (this.tooltip) {
    this.renderTooltipContent();
  }
}
```

First add the `setupLazy` method to the directive. It should set `didSetupLazy`
so that it's only called once and then call `SimpleTooltip.lazy`. The call to
`lazy` will store the `tooltip` on the directive and then call the
`renderTooltipContent` method that you'll implement next.

```ts
setupLazy() {
  this.didSetupLazy = true;
  SimpleTooltip.lazy(this.part!.element, (tooltip: SimpleTooltip) => {
    this.tooltip = tooltip;
    this.renderTooltipContent();
  });
}
```

Now add the `renderTooltipContent` method to the directive. It will call Lit's
`render` function to render the `tooltipContent` into the tooltip element.
You'll use the part's `renderOptions` so they stay in sync.

```ts
renderTooltipContent() {
  render(this.tooltipContent, this.tooltip!, this.part!.options);
}
```

Now open the `my-content.ts` module. That cumbersome code you previously added
to call `lazy` in `firstUpdated` has been removed and the `tooltip` directive
has been imported. Find the greeting and add the directive.

```html
<p>
  <span ${tooltip(html`${this.name}, there's coffee available in the lounge.`)}>
    Hello, ${this.name}!
  </span>
</p>
```

<aside class="info">You're just rendering text here, but since the directive
takes any value Lit can render, it could include rich HTML elements like images
or tables.</aside>

Finally, interact with the greeting to verify that the tooltip works.

You just created a nicely polished, easy to use, high performance tooltip
element. Great job, you're a tooltip expert!
