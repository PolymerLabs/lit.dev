You've polished the tooltip's behavior with animations. Now, you'll focus on
performance.

Since the tooltip doesn't display until the user interacts with
the target element, it does not need to be created or rendered until then. If
a page uses a lot of tooltips, which is not uncommon, adding this optimization
can speed up initial page rendering by a meaningful amount.

To do so, create a static method on the element class called `lazy`. It will
setup event listeners on the target element that listen on the same events
used to trigger the tooltip. You'll just call a supplied callback function
the first time one of these events are triggered. Near the top of the class
definition, add:

```ts
// Lazy creation
static lazy(target: Element, callback: (target: Element) => void) {
  let called = false;
  enterEvents.forEach(name => target.addEventListener(name, () => {
    if (!called) {
      called = true;
      callback(target);
    }
  }, {once: true}));
}
```
<aside class="info">Notice the <code>once</code> option is used to automatically
remove the event listener after it fires once. Since the callback should be
called only once and there are multiple triggering events, a flag is used to
manage the state.</aside>

Now open the `my-content` module. You'll change one of the tooltips to use
this `lazy` method. To do so, first add an `id` to the target and remove the
inline tooltip:

```html
<p>
  <span id="greeting">Hello, ${this.name}!</span>
</p>
```

Then add a `firstUpdated` method to setup the call to `lazy`:

```ts
firstUpdated() {
  const greeting = this.shadowRoot?.getElementById('greeting')!;
  SimpleTooltip.lazy(greeting, (target) => {
    const tip = document.createElement('simple-tooltip') as SimpleTooltip;
    tip.innerHTML = `${this.name}, there's coffee available in the lounge.`;
    greeting.parentNode?.insertBefore(tip, target.nextSibling);
    tip.show();
  });
}
```

The tooltip for the greeting element should work the same, but it's now created
on demand when one of the "enter" events is triggered.
