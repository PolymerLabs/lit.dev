In this tutorial we will be inventing our own HTML element: `<word-viewer>`. You
can see it on the right!

Lit makes inventing your own HTML tag easy! With this knowledge you can extend
HTML to fit your needs! Inventing your own HTML element means your component
will work anywhere HTML works, and since most frontend frameworks support HTML,
your custom elements work [everywhere](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/).

# What you'll build

You'll build this `word-viewer` component. It takes a list of words separated by
periods, and shows them one at a time. You use it in HTML like this:

```html
<word-viewer words="Hello.World"></word-viewer>
```

Clicking it plays the words in reverse, and changes some styles.

# What you'll learn

This is a weird thing to build, but in doing so we'll touch upon all the core
concepts you'll use when building your own Lit components:

* Defining your `<word-viewer></word-viewer>` custom element.
* Setting properties from HTML attributes.
* Rendering to show a single word.
* Lifecycle, and cycling the words.
* Basic styles.
* Basic events.
* Changing styles when play direction changes.

# Previous knowledge

This tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with JavaScript or TypeScript, as well
as some basics of Lit covered in the [Intro to Lit
Tutorial](/tutorials/intro-to-lit).

# Why

Lit is used in many of the world's [most forward-looking
organizations](https://lit.dev/#:~:text=looking%20organizations%20are-,building%20with%20Lit,-Spectrum%20Web%20Components).

It's also used to develop open source components that you can use:

 * [&lt;Model Viewer>](https://modelviewer.dev/) - Like an `<img>` tag but for
   3D!!!!
 * [Lion component library](https://lion-web.netlify.app/components/) -
   Fundamental white label web components for building  your design system.

There's nothing to solve in this tutorial part, it's here to show off what
you'll have built by the end. Add your own `<word-viewer>` tag in the list!

Press "Solve" to see more fun with the `<word-viewer>`, and when you're ready to
build click "Next".
