By the end of this step, we'll be able to set an attribute `words` on our
`word-viewer`, which will be set as a property on our `WordViewer` class.

`<word-viewer words="ðŸ‘‹.from.html"></word-viewer>`

We'll achieve this using a Lit feature called [_Reactive
Properties_](/docs/components/properties/). Define a reactive property `words`:

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
class WordViewer extends LitElement {
  @property() words = 'initial value';
  ...
}
```

```js
class WordViewer extends LitElement {
  static properties = {
    words: {},
  };

  constructor() {
    super();
    this.words = 'initial value';
  }
  ...
}
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Lit manages your reactive properties and their corresponding attributes. If the
reactive property `words` changes, the component schedules an update. By
default, Lit sets up an attribute for the property and will update the property
when the attribute changes.

You should now see `initial value` in the preview.

Before moving on, lets set `words` from an attribute.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<word-viewer words="ðŸ‘‹.from.html"></word-viewer>
```

The preview should now show `ðŸ‘‹.from.html`.

Debugging Custom Elements is awesome!

The browser understands your custom element so you can inspect it directly using
the browser's native developer tooling.

Change the `words` attribute in your browser's developer tools and note that the
component reacts to the change.
