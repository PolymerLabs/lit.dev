Lit has built-in attribute converters for basic types like number and boolean. In this step and the following one, you'll use a built-in attribute converter and some imperative code to set the `date` property from markup.


In this step, you start with a Lit component that:

  - Has a `date` reactive property of type `Date`.
  - Has attribute to property conversion turned off `{attribute: false}`.
  - Displays the `date` in a human-readable format.

The `date` property is set in `index.html`, using JavaScript.
The `date` property **can't** be set from an attribute, because Lit doesn't have a built-in attribute converter to convert a string date to a `Date` object.

Attribute converters tell Lit how to convert an attribute to a property and, in the case that a reactive property has the `reflect: true` flag, from property to attribute.

Lit has several built-in attribute converters. You can choose which built-in converter is invoked by [setting the `type` option](/docs/components/properties/#property-options) when you declare a reactive property. The built-in converters are:

* `String` *(default)*
* `Boolean`
* `Number`
* `Array`
* `Object`

For more information on built-in converters, see [Using the default converter](/docs/components/properties/#conversion-type).

In this step, you'll add a new `dateStr` reactive property that accepts a human-readable date string, and can be set from an attribute. (That is, `date-str="05/05/22"`.)

### Add the dateStr property

* Declare a `dateStr` reactive property of type `String`.
* Set the default value for `dateStr` to a string representation of `date`.
* Set the attribute for `dateStr` to be `date-str`.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
export class DateDisplay extends LitElement {
  @property({attribute: false})
  date = new Date();

  @property({type: String, attribute: 'date-str'})
  dateStr = '';
  ...
```

```js
export class DateDisplay extends LitElement {
  static properties = {
    date: {attribute: false},
    dateStr: {type: String, attribute: 'date-str'},
  };

  constructor() {
    super();
    this.date = new Date();
    this.dateStr = '';
  }
  ...
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Now setting the `date-str` attribute to `05/05/22` will update the `dateStr` property to `05/05/22` because the built-in `String` attribute converter is used! Unfortunately, you won't see any change to the output, because the `date` property isn't being updated.

In the next step, you'll fix that.
