Pointer Events are modelled after Mouse Events, and therefore have very similar naming.

  * `pointerdown`
    * Fired when a finger or pen touches the screen, or a mouse button is pressed.
  * `pointerup`
    * Fired when a finger or pen leaves the screen, or a mouse button is released.
  * `pointermove`
    * Fired when the mouse moves, or a finger or pen touching the screen moves.
  * `pointerover`
    * Fired when a pointer moves into an element.
  * `pointerout`
    * Fired when a pointer moves out of an element.
  * `pointerenter`
    * Similar to `pointerover`, but also fires for the element's descendants, and does not bubble.
  * `pointerleave`
    * Similar to `pointerout`, but also fires for the element's descendants, and does not bubble.

However, since Pointer Events are also used for touch, there are several more events that relate to touch-specific scenarios.

  * `pointercancel`
    * This event is fired if the browser decides that a touch interaction should scroll instead. Once this is fired, no more pointer events will fire for this interaction.
  * `gotpointercapture` and `lostpointercapture`
    * These events relate to [Pointer Capturing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events#capturing_the_pointer), which changes where Pointer Events are targeted, and is covered in a later section.
