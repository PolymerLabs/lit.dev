Pointer Capturing allows for a pointer to be retargeted to a chosen element, rather than the normal one set via hit testing.

In practice, this means you can make mouse interactions behave like touch, and touch interactions behave like mouse.
For completeness, touch pointers are considered "implicitly captured".

**Pointer Capturing API**

* To capture a pointer, you can use the `setPointerCapture(pointerId)` method on any HTML element.
* To release a pointer, you can use the `releasePointerCapture(pointerId)` method.

**Pointer Capturing Events**

When a pointer is captured or released, the element will fire a `gotpointercapture` or `lostpointercapture` event respectively.

Use your mouse, touchscreen, or pen in this example to see how the capturing or releasing the pointer changes behavior when dragging outside the box.
