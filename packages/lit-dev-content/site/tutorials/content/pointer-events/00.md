[Pointer Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events) are DOM events fired from any pointing device, including touch, mouse, and pen.

This unified model for handling user input events allows you to handle mobile, desktop, and tablet interactions with one set of event listeners, and no need to handle "compatibility" mouse events for touch.
