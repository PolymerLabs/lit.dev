Another powerful feature of Pointer Events is the ability to control the brower's native touch behavior with the use of the [`touch-action`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/touch-action) css property.

A pointer will fire events until the browser determines that a native behavior should occur, such as scrolling or zooming, at which point the browser will fire a final `pointercancel` event for the interaction.

**Touch Action Settings**

* `auto`
  * This is the default setting. This means that the browser will fire events until scrolling, zooming, or browser specific behavior such as "double tap to zoom" occurs.
* `none`
  * With this setting, the browser will always fire events, and will prevent all touch behaviors like scrolling and zooming.
* `pan-left`, `pan-right`, `pan-x`, `pan-up`, `pan-down`, and `pan-y`
  * These settings will let the browser scroll in the specified direction.
  * `pan-x` is shorthand for `pan-left pan-right`
  * `pan-y` is shorthand for `pan-up pan-down`
* `pinch-zoom`
  * This setting will let the browser perform pinch to zoom behaviors, but not scrolling or "double tap to zoom".
* `manipulation`
  * This setting is equivalent to `pan-x pan-y pinch-zoom`, only disabling "double tap to zoom" and other browser-specific behaviors.

Try using a touchscreen with this example to see how the different settings for `touch-action` control event firing and browser behavior.
