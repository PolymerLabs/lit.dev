We learned a lot about how to use lit-element to build our very own HTML element. We learned how to:

- Define a custom element
- Declare an attribute API
- Render a view for a custom element
- Encapsulate styles
- Use events and properties to pass data

If you want to learn more about lit-element, you can read more at its [official site](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/).

You can view a completed brick-viewer element at [stackblitz.com/edit/brick-viewer-complete](https://stackblitz.com/edit/brick-viewer-complete?file=brick-viewer.ts).

brick-viewer is also shipped on NPM, and you can view the source here: [Github repo](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/brick-viewer).
