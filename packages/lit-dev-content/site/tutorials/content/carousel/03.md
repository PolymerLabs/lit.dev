Now the `selected` property needs to actually do something. Use the
element's `slot` to manage the display of the selected item. Since only
elements assigned to slots render, assigning only the selected item will render
it and nothing else.

Update the `render` method and add the code below it.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
render() {
  return html`
    <div class="item">
      <slot name="selected"></slot>
    </div>
  `;
}

private previous = -1;
protected updated(changedProperties: PropertyValues) {
  if (changedProperties.has('selected') ||  this.previous === -1) {
    this.updateSlots();
    this.previous = this.selected;
  }
}

private updateSlots() {
  this.children[this.previous]?.removeAttribute('slot');
  this.children[this.selected]?.setAttribute('slot', 'selected');
}
```

```js
render() {
  return html`
    <div class="item">
      <slot name="selected"></slot>
    </div>
  `;
}

previous = -1;

updated(changedProperties) {
  if (changedProperties.has('selected') || this.previous === -1) {
    this.updateSlots();
    this.previous = this.selected;
  }
}

updateSlots() {
  this.children[this.previous]?.removeAttribute('slot');
  this.children[this.selected]?.setAttribute('slot', 'selected');
}
```

This sets the `name` attribute of the `slot` to `selected` so that only the
selected item is shown. The `updated` method is implemented to set the selected
element's `slot` to `selected`. Since the selected item is not rendered by Lit,
it needs to be managed directly with imperative code.

It's not common to directly manipulate element children like this since they are
not part of the carousel's encapsulated Shadow DOM. However, in this case
the change being made to the selected item is expressly related to the core
purpose of the element. In addition, the `slot` element has an
[`assign`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLSlotElement/assign)
method that removes the need to match the element's `slot` attribute to the
slot's name. However, at the time this tutorial has been authored, this isn't
yet widely supported so the code here sets the element's `slot`.

</litdev-aside>

The `changedProperties` argument to `updated` is used to do work only if
certain properties (here `selected`) have changed, and the previously selected
item is tracked so it can be un-slotted when `selected` changes.

To verify that changing the selected item does what's expected,
open `index.html` and add a `selected="1"` attribute to the `motion-carousel`
element. Setting the attribute will also set the property and should show the
appropriate image.
