In this tutorial, you'll build a simple carousel element animated with the
`@lit-labs/motion` package's `animate` directive.

#### Background
Carousels are a great way to show a large amount of related content in a
small visual space. Typically, the selected item animates into and out of view
and can be manipulated by swiping or clicking. Carousels are very commonly used
and knowing how to create one is an excellent skill to learn!

#### Preview
Here's a preview of the `motion-carousel` element. Try clicking the carousel
content to advance the selected item. Hold down shift while clicking to
move in the opposite direction.

#### Tasks
* Setup the element DOM and styling
* Add a `selected` property that displays the selected item
* Prepare to animate the selected item into view.
* Use the `animate` directive from the `@lit-labs/package` to add animation.

You're going to be a carousel genius!
