The carousel is now showing its first child item but there's no way
to change what's displayed. It needs a `selected` property to control which
item is shown.

Add the `selected` property accessor above the `render` method.

```ts
private isAdvancing = false;
private _selected = 0;
@property({type: Number})
get selected() {
  return this._selected;
}

set selected(i: number) {
  const max = this.childElementCount - 1;
  const old = this.selected;
  const wrapToStart = old === max && i > old;
  const wrapToEnd = old === 0 && i < old;
  const selected = wrapToStart ? 0 : (wrapToEnd ? max :
    Math.min(max, Math.max(0, i)));
  if (selected !== old) {
    this._selected = selected;
    this.isAdvancing = i > old;
    this.requestUpdate('selected', old);
  }
}
```

```js
static properties = { selected: {type: Number} };

isAdvancing = false;
_selected = 0;

get selected() {
  return this._selected;
}

set selected(i) {
  const max = this.childElementCount - 1;
  const old = this.selected;
  const wrapToStart = old === max && i > old;
  const wrapToEnd = old === 0 && i < old;
  const selected = wrapToStart ? 0 : (wrapToEnd ? max :
    Math.min(max, Math.max(0, i)));
  if (selected !== old) {
    this._selected = selected;
    this.isAdvancing = i > old;
    this.requestUpdate('selected', old);
  }
}
```

The property is reactive so the the element updates when it changes.

It's defined as an accessor to customize what happens when it's set. In particular,
the total number of selectable items is the `childElementCount`, and there's
a bit of code to make the value wrap if it goes out of range.

Because the property is implemented as custom property accessor,
you need to explicitly call `requestUpdate` to make the element update. See the
[docs](https://lit.dev/docs/components/properties/#accessors) for
more details about creating accessors.

The `isAdvancing` property will be used later for animation.
