The carousel is now showing its first child item but there's no way
to change what's displayed. Let's address that by adding a `selected` property
to control which item is shown.

The property should be reactive and we'll make it an accessor
so we can customize what happens when it's set. The total number of selectable
items will be the `childElementCount`, and we'll add a bit of code to make
the value wrap if it goes out of range. The `advancing` property will
be use later when we do animation. Because we've made a custom property accessor,
we need to call `requestUpdate` to make the element update. See the
[docs](https://lit.dev/docs/components/properties/#accessors) for
more details about creating accessors.
