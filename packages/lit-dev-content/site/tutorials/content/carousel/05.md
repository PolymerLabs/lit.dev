It works! But the visual experience can still be improved, and changing the
selected item is a bit jarring. This is a great place to use animation to
provide feedback about what's happening.

Animating elements can be tricky, so you'll tackle it in a few steps.
First, the DOM and styling needs to change a bit. When the selection changes,
the carousel should animate from the previously selected item to the newly
selected one. To do so, it needs to be able to display both the previous and
selected items.

Import the `styleMap` directive and update the render method as follows:

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
import {styleMap} from 'lit/directives/style-map.js';

// ...
private left = 0;
render() {
  if (this.hasValidSelected()) {
    this.selectedInternal = this.selected;
  }
  const animateLeft = ``;
  const selectedLeft = ``;
  const previousLeft = ``;
  return html`
    <div class="fit"
      @click=${this.clickHandler}
      style=${styleMap({left: animateLeft})}
    >
      <div class="fit" style=${styleMap({left: previousLeft})}>
        <slot name="previous"></slot>
      </div>
      <div class="fit selected" style=${styleMap({left: selectedLeft})}>
        <slot name="selected"></slot>
      </div>
    </div>
  `;
}
```

```js
import {styleMap} from 'lit/directives/style-map.js';

// ...
left = 0;
render() {
  if (this.hasValidSelected()) {
    this.selectedInternal = this.selected;
  }
  const animateLeft = ``;
  const selectedLeft = ``;
  const previousLeft = ``;
  return html`
    <div class="fit"
      @click=${this.clickHandler}
      style=${styleMap({left: animateLeft})}
    >
      <div class="fit" style=${styleMap({left: previousLeft})}>
        <slot name="previous"></slot>
      </div>
      <div class="fit selected" style=${styleMap({left: selectedLeft})}>
        <slot name="selected"></slot>
      </div>
    </div>
  `;
}
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

The selected item needs to slide into view. To do this, there's a slot for the
`previous` element. This enables the positions of the previously and currently
selected items to be managed.

There's a "container" element surrounding the items that will animate left or
right. The `@click` handler now makes more sense on the "container" so no
clicks are missed.

In the following steps, you will set the `left` property and use it to
calculate values for the `styleMap` directives used on the "container" and
the `previous` and `selected` slots.

The `selected` item will not display after this change to the template.
That's because it moves below the previous slot. You can verify this by
removing `overflow: hidden` in the `:host` selector. To fix this,
style the `selected` slot container's `top` to move it up.

Add the following css to the `styles` module:

### styles
```css
.selected {
  top: -100%;
}
```
