And our carousel is done, great job! You're now a carousel genius.

### Recap

Let's review the steps we took to make the carousel.

* Setup the element DOM with a slot and some styling
* Add a `selected` property that displays the selected item
  * Create the property
  * Render the selected item
  * Add a way to change the selected item
* Prepare to animate the selected item into view.
  * Prepare the template DOM by adding a slot for the previous item
  * Slot the previous item
  * Position the elements
* Use the `animate` directive from the `@lit-labs/package` to add animation.

We broke it down step by step and got it done. Again, great job!

Check out the code again if you'd like. We've tweaked things slightly to handle
some extreme corner cases that are commented in the code.

### Extra Credit
* Add additional controls to set the selected item; try buttons or swiping.
* Expose an option to disable animations or configure animation settings like
duration and easing. Hint, check out the [@lit-labs/motion readme](https://github.com/lit/lit/blob/main/packages/labs/motion/README.md#lit-labsmotion).
* Add a vertical mode that animates top <-> bottom instead of left <-> right.
