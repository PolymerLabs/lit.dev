And the carousel is done. Great job, you're now a carousel genius!

### Recap

Review the steps to make the carousel:

* Setup the element DOM with a slot and some styling
* Add a `selected` property that displays the selected item
  * Create the property
  * Render the selected item
  * Add a way to change the selected item
* Prepare to animate the selected item into view.
  * Modify the template DOM by adding a slot for the previous item
  * Slot the previous item
  * Position the elements
* Use the `animate` directive from the `@lit-labs/package` to add animation.

### Extra Credit
* Add additional controls to set the selected item; try buttons or swiping.
* Expose an option to disable animations or configure animation settings like
duration and easing. Hint, check out the [@lit-labs/motion readme](https://github.com/lit/lit/blob/main/packages/labs/motion/README.md#lit-labsmotion).
* Add a vertical mode that animates top <-> bottom instead of left <-> right.
