Here's a simple scaffold for the `motion-carousel` element, with the styling
separated into a module to make things more readable.
`<motion-carousel>` is used in `index.html` and is populated with a set of images.

The first task is to setup some basic DOM and styling for the carousel.
You may notice that the images inside the element are not visible. This is
because the element's Shadow DOM is displayed instead, and there is no
`slot` element. Check out the [docs](/docs/components/shadow-dom/#slots)
for more information about how slots work.

Add a `slot`:

```html
<div class="fit">
  <slot></slot>
</div>
```

And magically, the element content appears. Now the element needs some
basic styling so the items fit inside it.

Open the `styles` module and add the styling below:

### styles
```css
:host {
  display: inline-block;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: relative;
  /* Defaults */
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  background: gainsboro;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.fit {
  position: relative;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
}

::slotted(*) {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```

Since the carousel is in charge of displaying the selected item and managing
its appearance, it's easiest to require it to have an explicit size.
This way, you can ensure the items are contained inside the carousel.
That's done with `overflow` of `hidden`. The items are explicitly sized to
`100%` so they fit inside the carousel.

Notice the Shadow DOM css selectors: `:host` to style the element
itself and `::slotted(*)` to style all the slotted children.

The properties in the `:host` selector are effectively defaults for the
element and it's important to remember that the user can override
them to customize the appearance.
