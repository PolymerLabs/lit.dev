Now you're ready to position the elements.

Update the top of the `render` method to look like this:

```ts
render() {
  const p = this.selectedInternal;
  const s = (this.selectedInternal =
    this.hasValidSelected() ? this.selected : this.selectedInternal);
  const shouldMove = this.hasUpdated && s !== p;
  const atStart = p === 0;
  const toStart = s === 0;
  const atEnd = p === this.maxSelected;
  const toEnd = s === this.maxSelected;
  const shouldAdvance = shouldMove &&
    (atEnd ? toStart : atStart ? !toEnd : s > p);
  const delta = (shouldMove ? Number(shouldAdvance) || -1 : 0) * 100;
  this.left -= delta;
  const animateLeft = `${this.left}%`;
  const selectedLeft = `${-this.left}%`;
  const previousLeft = `${-this.left - delta}%`;
```

There's a bit of code here to review. It leverages the previously added code
to help position the elements.

First, `shouldMove` is computed based on the `selectedInternal`
tracking property changing and using ReactiveElement's `hasUpdated` property
to avoid animating the first render.

Then, `shouldAdvance` is computed so that the position advances if the selected
item increases, with the positioning reversed when wrapping to the start or end.

The move `delta` is calculated based on `shouldMove` and `shouldAdvance`.
The `left` property stores a `%` value indicating where the slot "container"
element should be positioned and is calculated using the move `delta`. `left`
is stored as a property on the element so re-renders apply the appropriate value
even if the `selected` property has not changed.

Finally, the positions are set based on the `left` property. The animating
container (`animateLeft`) is the position stored in `left`.
The selected item (`selectedLeft`) needs to be shown, so it's the inverse
of `left`. And for the previous item (`previousLeft`), it's placed to the left
or right of the selected item based on the move `delta`.

If that's all done correctly, the carousel's behavior should be the same
as the previous step when you click and shift-click the element.

If you'd like to verify the positioning of the previous item, open the
`styles` module and remove `overflow: hidden` in the `:host` selector.
