Now we're ready to position the elements. We use ReactiveElement's `hasUpdated`
property to avoid animating the first render, and we move only if selection
has changed (`this.selected !== this.previous`). We go to the right based on
the `advancing` property we setup in the `selected` accessor. Then calculate
the move `delta` and add that to the tracking `left` property. It stores a
`%` value indicating where the slot "container" element should be positioned.
It's stored as state so the element re-renders correctly if it updates and
the `selected` property has not changed.

Finally, update the positions based on the `left` property. The animating
container (`animateLeft`) is the position we've stored in `left`.
We want the selected item (`selectedLeft`) to be showing so we just negate
the `left` on the container so it stays in view. And for the previous item
(`previousLeft`), we place it to the left or right of the selected item based
on the move `delta`.

```ts
render() {
  const shouldMove = this.hasUpdated &&
      this.selected !== this.previous;
  const shouldAdvance = shouldMove && this.advancing;
  const delta = (shouldMove ? Number(shouldAdvance) || -1 : 0) * 100;
  this.left -= delta;
  const animateLeft = `${this.left}%`;
  const selectedLeft = `${-this.left}%`;
  const previousLeft = `${-this.left - delta}%`;
```

If we've done that correctly, nothing should change when we click and
shift-click the element to change the selection.

  Feel free to open the browser's developer tools and inspect the carousel's
  DOM to see that the style values for `left` are in fact changing in the
  three spots we set them.
