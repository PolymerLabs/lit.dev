Now that selection is implemented, add a way to control which item is selected.

There are a lot of options here; for example, you could provide buttons or support
swiping. For simplicity you'll change what's selected when the user clicks on the
carousel.

Update the `return` statement in the `render` method to add the `@click`
expression:

```ts
  return html`
    <div class="fit" @click=${this.clickHandler}>
```

Then add the `clickHandler` method below `render`:

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
private clickHandler(e: MouseEvent) {
  const i = this.selected + (Number(!e.shiftKey) || -1);
  this.selected = i > this.maxSelected ? 0 : i < 0 ? this.maxSelected : i;
  const change = new CustomEvent('change',
    {detail: this.selected, bubbles: true, composed: true});
  this.dispatchEvent(change);
}
```

```js
clickHandler(e) {
  const i = this.selected + (Number(!e.shiftKey) || -1);
  this.selected = i > this.maxSelected ? 0 : i < 0 ? this.maxSelected : i;
  const change = new CustomEvent('change',
    {detail: this.selected, bubbles: true, composed: true});
  this.dispatchEvent(change);
}
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

The `@click` expression in the template calls the `clickHandler` method when
the user clicks on the carousel. The event handler advances the `selected`
property, using the event's `shiftKey` property to allow the user to go back.
The value wraps to the first or last item when needed.

Since the element is changing the selected property based on user interactivity,
it should send an event describing what happened so other application code
can easily respond. The event name is `change` and it sends the selected item
info as its `detail`.

{% aside "positive" %}

Dispatch events when an element changes state based on user interaction, rather than when properties are set directly.

for more info.

Go ahead and try it out in the preview to make sure everything works.
