Now we need to add a way to control which item is selected. There are a lot of
options here; for example, we could provide buttons or support swiping.
For simplicity we'll just change what's selected when the user clicks on the
carousel.

We'll add a `@click` handler to the template that calls a `clickHandler` method.
The event handler will advance the `selected` property. We can also use the
event's `shiftKey` property to allow the user to go back.

Since the element is changing the selected property based on user interactivity,
it's a good practice to dispatch an event describing what happened. This way
other application code can easily respond when the carousel's selected item
changes. We'll just call the event `change` and send the selected item as
the event's `detail`.

Update the `render` method and add the code below it.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
render() {
  return html`
    <div class="fit" @click=${this.clickHandler}>
      <slot name="selected"></slot>
    </div>
  `;
}

private clickHandler(e: MouseEvent) {
  this.selected += Number(!e.shiftKey) || -1;
  const change = new CustomEvent('change',
    {detail: this.selected, bubbles: true, composed: true});
  this.dispatchEvent(change);
}
```

```js
render() {
  return html`
    <div class="fit" @click=${this.clickHandler}>
      <slot name="selected"></slot>
    </div>
  `;
}

clickHandler(e) {
  this.selected += Number(!e.shiftKey) || -1;
  const change = new CustomEvent('change',
    {detail: this.selected, bubbles: true, composed: true});
  this.dispatchEvent(change);
}
```

Go ahead and try it out in the preview to make sure everything works.
