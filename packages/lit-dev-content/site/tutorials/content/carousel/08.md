Now the element is animating left and right when the selection changes, but
things don't look right because we haven't slotted the items correctly. When
the selection advances, we want to place the `previous` selected item in the
center `selected` `slot` and the currently `selected` item in the `end` `slot`
to its right. Then when the animation finishes, the next update we triggered
should place the `selected` item back in the `selected` `slot` that will be
shown without animation. When not advancing, we do the same thing with the
other `start` `slot`.
