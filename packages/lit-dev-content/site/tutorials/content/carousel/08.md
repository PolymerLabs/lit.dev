You're ready to add the animation.

You may notice a little indicator near the bottom of the element has been
added in this step. It shows which item is selected in the carousel. You can
inspect the code in the `render` method to see how this was done. It follows a
similar pattern to position `left` and `width` based on the `selected` item.

Now import the `animate` directive from the `@lit-labs/motion` package.

{% aside "warn" %}

  Packages released under `@lit-labs` aren't quite ready for production.

  These projects may be experimental or incomplete, and they're
  subject to breaking changes. See the Lit [documentation](/docs/libraries/labs/)
  for more info.

{% endaside %}

Add the import after the other import statements at the top of the module.

```ts
import {animate} from '@lit-labs/motion';
```

{% aside "info" "no-header" %}

Normally, you'd also need to add `@lit-labs/motion` to your
`package.json` but to speed things up, that's already been done.

The `animate` directive will take care of animating the position. It's
great for ["tweening"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbetweening)
between different rendered layouts.

Add the `animate` directive to the "container" surrounding the slots in the
`return` statement of the `render` method:

```ts
return html`
  <div class="fit"
    ${animate()}
```

Now add the `animate` directive to the `indicator` element at the bottom of
the `render` method:

```ts
  <div class="indicator"
    ${animate()}
```

Note that even though you're setting the `left` property,
the `animate` directive is actually animating the css `transform` property.
This is much more efficient since it does not require the browser to perform
layout or style recalculation.

The `animate` directive is intended to be very simple to use, but it has a lot
of configuration options. Check out the [@lit-labs/motion readme](https://github.com/lit/lit/blob/main/packages/labs/motion/README.md#lit-labsmotion)
for more information.

Now try clicking the element...
