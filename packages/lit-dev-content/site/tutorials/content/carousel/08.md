Now we're ready to add the animation. To do so, we'll import the `animate`
directive from the `@lit-labs/motion` package.

<aside class="warning">
  Packages release under the <code>@lit-labs</code> umbrella aren't quite ready for
  production. These projects may be experimental or incomplete, and they're
  subject to breaking changes. See the <a href="https://lit.dev/docs/libraries/labs/">docs</a>
  for more info.
</aside>

```ts
import {animate} from '@lit-labs/motion';
```

<aside class="info">
  Normally, you'd also need to add <code>@lit-labs/motion</code> to your
  <code>package.json</code> but to speed things up, that's already been done.

The `animate` directive will take care of animating the position. It's
great for "tweening" between different rendered layouts. Add the `animate`
directive to the "container" surrounding the slots:

```ts
return html`
  <div class="fit"
    ${animate()}
```

Note that even though we're setting the <code>left</code> property,
the <code>animate</code> directive is actually animating the css
<code>transform</code> property. This is much more efficient
since it does not require the browser to perform layout or style
recalculation.

The `animate` directive is intended to be very simple to use, but it has a lot
of configuration options. Check out the [@lit-labs/motion readme](https://github.com/lit/lit/blob/main/packages/labs/motion/README.md#lit-labsmotion)
for more information.
