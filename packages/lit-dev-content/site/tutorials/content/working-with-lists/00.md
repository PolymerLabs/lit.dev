This tutorial will be exploring different ways of rendering a list of
items in Lit!

## Previous knowledge
It's recommended to have an understanding of
[defining a component](/docs/components/defining/),
[rendering](/docs/components/rendering/), and
[reactive properties](/docs/components/properties/) before
working on this tutorial. The [Intro to Lit](/tutorials/intro-to-lit/) tutorial
is a great place to start.


## Rendering a list
Begin by rendering a list of names from an array. The example already has set
up a custom element with the `names` property that is an array of type strings.

The `map` array prototype method can be utilized to generate a list item
for each item in the array. Place the code snippet below in the return of the
`render` method within the unordered list (`<ul></ul>`).

```ts
// my-element.ts
${this.names.map((name) => html`<li>${name}</li>`)}
```

```js
// my-element.js
${this.names.map((name) => html`<li>${name}</li>`)}
```
