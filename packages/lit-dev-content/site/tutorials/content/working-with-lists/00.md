This tutorial will be exploring different ways of rendering a list of
items in Lit!

## Previous knowledge
It's recommended to have an understanding of
[defining a component](/docs/components/defining/),
[rendering](/docs/components/rendering/), and
[reactive properties](/docs/components/properties/) before
working on this tutorial. The [Intro to Lit](/tutorials/intro-to-lit/) tutorial
is a great place to start.

## What you'll learn
- Rendering a list from an array
- Imperatively building an array of items to render
- Utilizing the `map` directive
- Utilizing the `repeat` directive

## Rendering a list
Begin by rendering a list of names from an array. The example already has set
up a custom element with the `names` property that is an array of type strings.

Use the `map` array prototype method to generate a list item for each item in
the array by placing the code snippet below in the return of the `render`
method within the unordered list (`<ul></ul>`).

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
// my-element.ts
${this.names.map((name) => html`<li>${name}</li>`)}
```

```js
// my-element.js
${this.names.map((name) => html`<li>${name}</li>`)}
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

This leverages Lit's ability to easily compose templates by placing an array
of templates returned by the `map` method directly into the template being
rendered by the component.
