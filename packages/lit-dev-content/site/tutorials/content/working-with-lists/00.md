This tutorial explores different ways of rendering lists of items in
Lit!

Lit makes it easy to render any list of items. It has built-in support for
iterables: pass an array (or other iterable) to a child expression and Lit will
render each item in the array. This, combined with Lit's ability to render
nested templates, and JavaScript patterns for transforming lists of data into
lists of templates, allows for very flexible list handling.

## What you'll learn
- Rendering lists with the `map()` directive.
- Transforming arrays into templates with array methods.
- Generating lists with the `range()` directive.
- Imperatively building arrays of items.
- Diffing lists of stateful elements with the `repeat()` directive.
- Using event listeners in a list.

## Previous knowledge
This tutorial assumes that you've completed the
[Intro to Lit](/tutorials/intro-to-lit/) tutorial,
or you're already familiar with some of the basics of Lit:
[defining a component](/docs/components/defining/),
[rendering](/docs/components/rendering/),
[reactive properties](/docs/components/properties/), and
[adding an event listener](/docs/components/events/#adding-event-listeners-in-the-element-template).
