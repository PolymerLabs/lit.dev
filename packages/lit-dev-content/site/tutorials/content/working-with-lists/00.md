This tutorial will be exploring different ways of rendering a list of items in
Lit!

Lit makes it easy to render any lists of items. It has built-it support for
iterables of any supported values. This, along with Lit's ability to render
nested templates and helpful built-in directives, allow for rendering any
variety of lists.

## What you'll learn
- Utilizing the `map` directive
- Using array prototype methods
- Building static list and using the `range` directive
- Imperatively building an array of items to render
- Utilizing the `repeat` directive
- Handling event listeners in items rendered from a list

## Previous knowledge
It is recommended to have basic understandings of
[defining a component](/docs/components/defining/),
[rendering](/docs/components/rendering/),
[reactive properties](/docs/components/properties/), and
[adding an event listener](/docs/components/events/#adding-event-listeners-in-the-element-template)
before working on this tutorial. The [Intro to Lit](/tutorials/intro-to-lit/)
tutorial is a great place to start.
