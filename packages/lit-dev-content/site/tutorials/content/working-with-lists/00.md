This tutorial will be exploring different ways of rendering lists of items in
Lit!

Lit makes it easy to render any lists of items. It has built-it support for
iterables: pass an array (or other iterable) to a child expression and Lit will
render each item in the array. This, combined with Lit's ability to render
nested templates, and JavaScript patterns for transforming lists of data into
lists of templates, allows for very flexible list handling.

## What you'll learn
- Rendering lists with the `map()` directive
- Transforming arrays into templates with array methods
- Generating lists with the `range()` directive
- Imperatively building arrays of items
- Diffing lists of stateful elements with the `repeat()` directive
- Using event listeners in a list

## Previous knowledge
It is recommended to have basic understandings of
[defining a component](/docs/components/defining/),
[rendering](/docs/components/rendering/),
[reactive properties](/docs/components/properties/), and
[adding an event listener](/docs/components/events/#adding-event-listeners-in-the-element-template)
before working on this tutorial. The [Intro to Lit](/tutorials/intro-to-lit/)
tutorial is a great place to start.
