Any valid JavaScript expressions that result in valid renderable values
described in the [expressions documentation](/docs/templates/expressions/) can
be placed within the tagged template literal. When working with arrays, their
prototype methods can be utilized to generate arrays of renderable values as
well.

This example contains a component with a `names` property containing an array of
strings.

Use the `.filter` method to only keep the names that include the letter "e"
followed by a `.map` call to generate an array of template results to place in
component's template.

```ts
// my-element.ts
  render() {
    return html`
      ...
      <ul>
      ${this.names
        .filter((name) => name.match(/e/i))
        .map((name) => html`<li>${name}</li>`)}
      </ul>
    `;
  }
```

```js
// my-element.js
  render() {
    return html`
      ...
      <ul>
      ${this.names
        .filter((name) => name.match(/e/i))
        .map((name) => html`<li>${name}</li>`)}
      </ul>
    `;
  }
```

Using array methods is helpful when chaining like this, but does require the
original source to be an array. Consider using the `map` directive as shown in
the previous step for any iterables that are not arrays.
