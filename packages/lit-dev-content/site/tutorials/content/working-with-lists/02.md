The previous step showed how a `for ... of` loop can be used to populate an
array of templates to render. However, Lit also provides a built-in
`map` directive that will map over any iterable including `Map`s, `Set`s, and
even generators, in addition to arrays.

To simplify the previous step by using it, first import the `map` directive.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
// my-element.ts
import {map} from 'lit/directives/map.js';
```

```js
// my-element.js
import {map} from 'lit/directives/map.js';
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Then use the directive in the rendered template.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
// my-element.ts
${map(this.items, (item) => html`<li>${item}</li>`)}
```

```js
// my-element.js
${map(this.items, (item) => html`<li>${item}</li>`)}
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

The index of the item is also made available to the callback function. Check
out the [documentation](/docs/templates/directives/#map) for details.
