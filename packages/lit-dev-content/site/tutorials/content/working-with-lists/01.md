Sometimes you may want to render a list from another type of iterable,
such as a `Set`. Note the data in this example has been changed from an
array to a `Set`.

Lit provides a built-in `map` directive that will map over any iterable
including `Map`s, `Set`s, and even generators, in addition to arrays.

Begin by importing the `map` directive.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
// my-element.ts
import {map} from 'lit/directives/map.js';
```

```js
// my-element.js
import {map} from 'lit/directives/map.js';
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Then use the directive in the rendered template.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
// my-element.ts
${map(this.items, (item) => html`<li>${item}</li>`)}
```

```js
// my-element.js
${map(this.items, (item) => html`<li>${item}</li>`)}
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

The index of the item is also made available to the callback function. Check
out the [documentation](/docs/templates/directives/#map) for details.

The `map` directive is a useful tool when working with simple cases that easily
lend themselves to declarative description. However, more complex situations
may arise where imperative code might be necessary to build up a list. The next
step will show an example.
