Congratulations on completing the **Working with Lists** tutorial!

## Takeaways

- Lit has built-in support for rendering iterables! Just place arrays, sets,
  maps, or generators directly into the template expression.
- Use the `map()` directive for a declarative way of taking an iterable and
  transforming each item into some renderable template. Use it when all
  necessary states are controlled by Lit.
- For complex situations involving more logic, an array of renderables can be
  manually built and placed into the component template. Consider using a
  separate private method to abstract the related logic out of the `render()`
  method.
- Use the `repeat()` directive when relying on the DOM nodes for some state or
  otherwise needing a tight coupling between the DOM and the list item. Provide
  a key function that produces a unique key for each item of the iterable.
- Consider using the `range()` directive along with `map()` to programmatically
  generate a list. These can be nested to produce a multi-dimensional grid as
  well.
- Lastly, when adding event listeners to items rendered from a list, make sure
  the handler has access to the data it needs that's specific to each item.
  Using an inline arrow function is often a good way to achieve this by creating
  closures.

## Further learning

Check out other [built-in directives](/docs/templates/directives/) besides
`map()`, `repeat()`, and `range()` that are available, or learn how to make your
very own [custom directive](/docs/templates/custom-directives/)!
