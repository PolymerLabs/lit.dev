Congratulations on completing the **Working with Lists** tutorial!

This tutorial showed how lists can be rendered with the `map` array prototype
method, by manually building an array of templates, or by using the `map` or
`repeat` built-in directives.

See [When to use map or repeat](https://lit.dev/docs/templates/lists/#when-to-use-map-or-repeat)
for details on when you might want to use one or the other.

## Further learning
Check out other [built-in directives](https://lit.dev/docs/templates/directives/)
besides `map` and `repeat` that are available, or learn how to make a
[custom directive](https://lit.dev/docs/templates/custom-directives/)!
