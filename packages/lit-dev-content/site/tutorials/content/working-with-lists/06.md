There are several ways of adding event listeners to list items getting rendered,
but care must be taken to ensure the correct information is made available to
the event handler. This step shows one way of achieving this.

The example currently has an array of strings in the `things` property that are
being rendered as list items with a "Delete" button which does not do anything
yet.

First, create a method that will be called when the button is clicked that will
remove the item from the `things` array. It will take the item's index.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
// my-element.ts
class MyElement extends LitElement {
  ⋮
  private _deleteThing(index: number) {
    this.things.splice(index, 1);
    this.requestUpdate();
  }
}
```

```js
// my-element.js
class MyElement extends LitElement {
  ⋮
  _deleteThing(index) {
    this.things.splice(index, 1);
    this.requestUpdate();
  }
}
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

{% aside "warn" %}

Call `this.requestUpdate()` to render array mutations.

Since the `splice()` array method mutates the array without changing the
reference stored in `this.things`, Lit will not know that its content has
changed. Calling `requestUpdate()` triggers the component to update using the
new contents of the array.

{% endaside %}

Now register the handler on the button for each item as the array is being
mapped.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
// my-element.ts
  render() {
    return html`
      ⋮
      <ul>
        ${map(
          this.things,
          (thing, index) => html`
            <li>
              ${thing}
              <button @click=${() => this._deleteThing(index)}>Delete</button>
            </li>
          `
        )}
      </ul>
    `;
  }
```

```js
// my-element.js
  render() {
    return html`
      ⋮
      <ul>
        ${map(
          this.things,
          (thing, index) => html`
            <li>
              ${thing}
              <button @click=${() => this._deleteThing(index)}>Delete</button>
            </li>
          `
        )}
      </ul>
    `;
  }
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Now clicking the delete button should remove the item. Note that an inline arrow
function is used here to create closures such that each list item gets a
function that calls `_deleteThing` with its own index.

{% aside "info" %}

While closures will be fine for most cases, there are other ways to achieve this
behavior.

For instance, a property or attribute can be left on the element with the
listener which can then be accessed by the event handler via `event.target`.
When listening to an event that bubbles, using event delegation can be a
convenient way of handling it without attaching event listeners on every item.

templates](/docs/components/events/#listening-to-events-fired-from-repeated-templates).
