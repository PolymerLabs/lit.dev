Congratulations on completing the **Working with Lists** tutorial!

This tutorial showed how lists can be rendered with the `map` array prototype
method or by using the `map` built-in directive for other iterables. Manually
building an array of renderables imperatively is useful for complex situations
requiring more logic. Use the `repeat` built-in directive when a tigher
coupling between the DOM and the list item is needed. When adding event
listeners to items rendered through iteration, make sure the handler has
access to the data it needs, that's specific to each item.

## Further learning
Check out other [built-in directives](/docs/templates/directives/)
besides `map` and `repeat` that are available, or learn how to make a
[custom directive](/docs/templates/custom-directives/)!
