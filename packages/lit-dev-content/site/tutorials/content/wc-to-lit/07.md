## Styling Buttons With Attributes

Now all that's missing is the button functionality. This component should allow the user to provide a single up or down vote rating and give visual feedback to the user. In this step you'll do some setup work:

* Add a new `vote` property and attribute, like the `rating` property you added previously.
* Add new styles for the vote-up and vote-down buttons based on the current value of the `vote` attribute.

Then in the following step you'll add the event listeners to handle button clicks and set the `vote` attribute.

Start by adding the following lines:

### index.html

```css
<template>
  <style>
    ...

    :host([vote=up]) .thumb_up {
      fill: green;
    }
    :host([vote=down]) .thumb_down {
      fill: red;
    }
  </style>
</template>
```

In shadow DOM the `:host` selector refers to the node or custom element that the shadow root is attached to.

In this case, if the `vote` attribute is `"up"` (e.g. `<rating-element vote="up">`) it will turn the thumb-up button green.

If `vote` is `"down"` (e.g. `<rating-element vote="down">`), then it will turn the thumb-down button red.

Now, implement the logic for this by creating a reflecting property / attribute for `vote` similar to how you implemented `rating`. Start with the property setter and getter:

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
export class RatingElement extends HTMLElement {
  private _rating = 0;
  private _vote: 'up'|'down'|null = null;

  ...

  set vote(newValue) {
    const oldValue = this._vote;
    if (newValue === oldValue) {
      return;
    }

    if (newValue === 'up') {
      if (oldValue === 'down') {
        this.rating += 2;
      } else {
        this.rating += 1;
      }
    } else if (newValue === 'down') {
      if (oldValue === 'up') {
        this.rating -= 2;
      } else {
        this.rating -= 1;
      }
    }

    this._vote = newValue;
    this.setAttribute('vote', newValue!);
  }

  get vote() {
    return this._vote;
  }
}
```

```js
export class RatingElement extends HTMLElement {
  _vote = null;

  ...

  set vote(newValue) {
    const oldValue = this._vote;
    if (newValue === oldValue) {
      return;
    }

    if (newValue === 'up') {
      if (oldValue === 'down') {
        this.rating += 2;
      } else {
        this.rating += 1;
      }
    } else if (newValue === 'down') {
      if (oldValue === 'up') {
        this.rating -= 2;
      } else {
        this.rating -= 1;
      }
    }

    this._vote = newValue;
    this.setAttribute('vote', newValue);
  }

  get vote() {
    return this._vote;
  }
}
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Initialize the `_vote` instance property with `null` as a class-member property,
and in the setter, check if the new value is different. If so, adjust the
`rating` accordingly and, importantly, reflect the `vote` attribute back to the
host with `this.setAttribute`.

{% aside "warn" %}

It is not recommended to manipulate `rating` inside the `vote` setter in this way.

This is not the most efficient way to update `rating`, but it's the most convenient way for this tutorial.

{% endaside %}

## Handle "vote" Attribute Changes

Next, set up the attribute binding for `vote`:

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
static get observedAttributes() {
  return ['rating', 'vote'];
}

attributeChangedCallback(attributeName: string, _oldValue: string, newValue: string) {
  if (attributeName === 'rating') {
    const newRating = Number(newValue);

    this.rating = newRating;
  } else if (attributeName === 'vote') {
    this.vote = newValue as 'up'|'down';
  }
}
```

```js
static get observedAttributes() {
  return ['rating', 'vote'];
}

attributeChangedCallback(attributeName, _oldValue, newValue) {
  if (attributeName === 'rating') {
    const newRating = Number(newValue);

    this.rating = newRating;
  } else if (attributeName === 'vote') {
    this.vote = newValue;
  }
}
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

This is the same process you went through with the `rating` attribute binding:

* Add `'vote'` to the `observedAttributes`.
* Set the `vote` property in the `attributeChangedCallback`.

Check that this is working by setting the `vote` attribute to `"up"` in the
browser dev tools console with `$0.setAttribute('vote', 'up')`.
