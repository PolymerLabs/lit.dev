Before we make our directive update asynchronously, first let's get a 3rd-party
library for formatting string durations.

The `timeago` npm package accepts a date, and returns a string describing the
time that has elapsed since that date in human-readable form, like "just now" or
"5 minutes ago" or "3 years ago", etc..

Add the package to `package.json`:

```json
    "timeago.js": "^4.0.2"
```

Then import the `format` helper into your `time-ago.ts` directive module:

```ts
import {format} from 'timeago.js';
```

Last, update the render method to use `format`:

```ts
    return format(time);
```

You should now see the string updated to say "just now". But it doesn't yet
update. In fact, if this is all we wanted, we didn't need to use a directive at
all; we could have just used the `format` function directly in the template:

```ts
// So far our directive is just equivalent to:
return html`<p>The page was rendered ${format(time)}`
```

However, plain functions can't update the value they rendered after the fact. In
order to make a template helper that asynchronously renders a constantly
up-to-date string describing how much time is passed, we'll need to use an
`AsyncDirective`.
