First, add the scaffolding for a basic custom directive. Make a class that
extends `Directive`, and then export a directive function created by passing the
class to the `directive` factory. The exported function is what users will call
from their template.

```ts
import {directive, Directive} from 'lit/directive.js';

class TimeAgoDirective extends Directive {
}

export const timeAgo = directive(TimeAgoDirective);
```

Next, every directive must implement a `render` method. Add one to your class
that accepts a `time` argument as a `Date` object. For now, make a simple
version that just returns a string version of the time. We'll make this fancier
in a later step.

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
  render(time: Date) {
    return time.toDateString();
  }
```

```js
  render(time) {
    return time.toDateString();
  }
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}


You won't see anything output yet, because we haven't rendered the directive
anywhere.
