In this step, take a moment to confirm the `disconnect()` and `reconnect()`
lifecycle are working as expected.

Add some code to the example element that removes the host element from the DOM
for a second, then puts it back in. In the `time-ago-example` element's
template, add the `@click` event listener to the `<p>`:

```ts
    return html`
      <p @click=${this.handleClick}>
        This page was rendered ${timeAgo(timeCreated)}.
      </p>
    `;
```

And then add this method to the class. As you see, the host element will be
removed, and then a second later it will be re-inserted into the DOM:

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
  handleClick() {
    const parent = this.parentNode;
    this.remove();
    setTimeout(() => parent!.appendChild(this), 1000);
  }
```

```js
  handleClick() {
    const parent = this.parentNode;
    this.remove();
    setTimeout(() => parent.appendChild(this), 1000);
  }
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Next, in our `time-ago` directive class, add some log statements to
`ensureTimerStarted` and `ensureTimerStopped`:

```ts
  ensureTimerStarted() {
    console.log('timer started');
    ...
  }
```

```ts
  ensureTimerStopped() {
    console.log('timer stopped');
    ...
  }
```

If you open devtools, you should see a log statement after the initial render:

```md
timer started
```

When you click on the text rendered in the sample element, the element
will be disconnected for a second, and then reconnected. You should see two
more log statements, one for the disconnection, another for the reconnection:

```md
timer stopped
timer started
```

If you comment out the last line of `handleClick` that reconnects the element
and click on the text, you should see the log statements indicate the timer
stopped and did not restart -- confirming the directive will be properly cleaned
up if the element it was rendered into is discarded.
