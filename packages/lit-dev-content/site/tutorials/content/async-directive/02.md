This step provides a sample element with a template. Go ahead and try importing your
directive, and then use it in a template.

```ts
import {timeAgo} from './time-ago.js';
```

Next, create a `Date` object at the module-level, above the `TimeAgoExample`
class definition that we'll use to pass to the directive, just to see it
working:

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
const timeCreated = new Date();

@customElement('time-ago-example')
export class TimeAgoExample extends LitElement {
  ...
```

```js
const timeCreated = new Date();

export class TimeAgoExample extends LitElement {
  ...
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}


And then call the directive from the template:

```ts
    return html`
      <p>This page was rendered ${timeAgo(timeCreated)}.</p>
    `;
```

You should see the directive output the Date as a string. The next step will
format it as elapsed time instead.
