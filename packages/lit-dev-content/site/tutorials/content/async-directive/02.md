We've provided a sample element with a template. Go ahead and try importing your
directive, and then we'll use it in a template.

```ts
import {timeAgo} from './time-ago.js';
```

Next, create a module-scoped `Date` object that we'll use to pass to the
directive, just to see it working:

```ts
const timeCreated = new Date();
```

And then call the directive from the template:

```ts
    return html`
      <p>This page was rendered ${timeAgo(timeCreated)}.</p>
    `;
```

You should see the directive output the Date as a string. In the next
step we'll format it as elapsed time instead.
