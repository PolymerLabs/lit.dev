Instead of extending the basic `Directive` class, import and extend
`AsyncDirective`.

```ts
import {directive, AsyncDirective} from 'lit/async-directive.js';

class TimeAgoDirective extends AsyncDirective {
```

The `AsyncDirective` base class adds a few new methods useful for directives
that need to do asynchronous rendering:
* `setValue()` - Can be called from an async task or event callback
  outside of the template's update cycle, in order to render a new value
  asynchronously.
* `disconnected()` - Async directives typically need to subscribe to some sort
  of asynchronous source (awaiting a promise, registering a callback, listening
  to a DOM event, etc.). This callback allows the directive to unsubscribe and
  perform any clean up work if its DOM was removed. Without this, directives
  could leak memory.
* `reconnected()` - Like `disconnected()`, it is also possible that a directive
  that was removed is subsequently re-connected to the DOM. Thus, async
  directives should always implement a `reconnected` callback to become
  operational again after having been disconnected.

We will make use of these methods later in the tutorial.
