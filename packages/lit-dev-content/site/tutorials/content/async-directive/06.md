The thing we want to do in the timer callback is to update the value rendered by
the directive -- but notice the timer callback fires _outside_ of the normal
directive `update`/`render` lifecycle where we normally return a value for
the directive to render.

Here, we can use `AsyncDirective`'s `setValue` API to update the directive's
value, outside of the directive's normal update cycle. To do this, we'll need to
store the time passed to `update` in another class field:

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
  time!: Date;

  update(part: Part, [time]: DirectiveParameters<this>) {
    this.time = time;
    ...
  }
```

```js
  update(part, [time]) {
    this.time = time;
    ...
  }
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

This way we can reference the user's value passed in when the template was
rendered from our timer callback.

And then in our timer callback, we can call `setValue`, using our `render`
result, which will re-format the date using the currently elapsed time.

```ts
        this.setValue(this.render(this.time));
```

Congratulations! If you wait a few seconds, you should now see time rendered
using the directive update periodically, using the `timeago` library's rules for
incrementally scaling from "just now" to "seconds ago" to "minutes ago", etc..

<aside class="warning">

**Don't stop here.** If we stopped at this point, while our directive would
work, we would have a potential memory leak. That's because if the element was
removed, the timer would keep on firing, holding on to the directive and
underlying DOM.

Next, we'll add lifecycle for cleaning up the directive when it's no longer
needed.
