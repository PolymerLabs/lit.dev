In this tutorial, we'll take a look at creating custom async directives, which
are a powerful feature in Lit for building template helpers.

Async directives provide additional API and lifecycle to the standard directive
API, allowing the directive to update its value asynchronously and cleanup any
subscriptions when the directive is no longer in use.

<h2>What you'll learn</h2>

* How to make a basic `Directive`
* The additional directive API added by `AsyncDirective`
* How to update a directive's value asynchronously using `setValue`
* How to perform cleanup work in the `disconnected()` callback
* Why implementing the `reconnected()` callback is also important

<h2>What you'll build</h2>

You will make a `timeAgo(date)` directive that accepts a JavaScript `Date`, and
renders human-readable string showing the time that has passed. The directive
will re-render its value periodically, so that the string always reflects the
time that has passed. We'll be able to then use the directive in a variety of
scenarios, as shown to the right.

<h2>Previous knowledge</h2>

It's recommended you familiarize yourself with the basics of Lit's [directive
API](/docs/templates/custom-directives/?mods=tutorialCatalog#async-directives)
before starting this tutorial.
