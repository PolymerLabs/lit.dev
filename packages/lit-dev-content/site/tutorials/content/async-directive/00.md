This tutorial will take a look at creating custom async directives, which
are a powerful feature in Lit for building template helpers.

Standard directives are stateful template helpers that can access the underlying
DOM associated with their position in the template. Async directives expand the
directive API and lifecycle, allowing the directive to update its rendered
result asynchronously and cleanup any subscriptions when the directive is no
longer in use.

<h2>What you'll learn</h2>

* How to make a basic `Directive`
* The additional directive API added by `AsyncDirective`
* How to update a directive's value asynchronously using `setValue`
* How to perform cleanup work in the `disconnected()` callback
* Why implementing the `reconnected()` callback is also important

<h2>What you'll build</h2>

You will make a `timeAgo(date)` directive that accepts a JavaScript `Date`, and
renders human-readable string showing the time that has passed. The directive
will re-render its value periodically, so that the string always reflects the
time that has passed.  We'll be able to then use the directive in a variety of
scenarios.

<h2>Previous knowledge</h2>

We'll assume you have a basic understanding of directives in Lit. Familiarize
yourself with [directive
concepts](/docs/templates/custom-directives/?mods=tutorialCatalog#async-directives)
before starting if needed.
