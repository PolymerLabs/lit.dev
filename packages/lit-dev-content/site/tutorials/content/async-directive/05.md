To make our directive update asynchronously, we'll need to start a timer that
re-renders the time elapsed.

Add a function that starts a periodic 1s timer if it's not already started.
Since directives are stateful, we can use a class field to store the timer's
handle, and use that to start the timer only once:

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
  timer: number | undefined;

  ensureTimerStarted() {
    if (this.timer === undefined) {
      this.timer = setInterval(() => {
        /* do some periodic work */
      }, 1000);
    }
  }
```

```js
  timer = undefined;

  ensureTimerStarted() {
    if (this.timer === undefined) {
      this.timer = setInterval(() => {
        /* do some periodic work */
      }, 1000);
    }
  }
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}


We will start the timer in the `update` lifecycle callback.  The default
implementation of `update` simply calls `render`, but since `update` is [_not_
called during
SSR](https://lit.dev/docs/templates/custom-directives/#differences-between-update()-and-render()),
`update` is the right spot to start/subscribe to asynchronous tasks we don't
want running on the server.

Add the `update` callback. Call `ensureTimerStarted()` and then return the
result of `render`. Note that we only want the timer running if the directive is
currently connected (in some cases update could possibly be called when the
directive has been disconnected, so you should always check `isConnected` before
doing work that might require cleanup):

{% switchable-sample %}

```ts
import {DirectiveParameters, Part} from 'lit/directive.js';

...

  update(part: Part, [time]: DirectiveParameters<this>) {
    if (this.isConnected) {
      this.ensureTimerStarted();
    }
    return this.render(time);
  }
```

```js
  update(part, [time]) {
    if (this.isConnected) {
      this.ensureTimerStarted();
    }
    return this.render(time);
  }
```

{% endswitchable-sample %}

Our directive now starts a periodic timer the first time it is rendered,
although it doesn't do anything interesting yet.
