# Announcing @lit-labs/signals: Integrating the TC39 Signals Proposal with Lit

We’re thrilled to announce the release of our newest Lit Labs package,
`@lit-labs/signals`, which integrates the exciting new [TC39 Signals
Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals) polyfill directly with Lit.
This package provides a powerful, reactive way to manage state in your web
applications by allowing you to use shared, observable signals that
automatically update components when their values change.

Signals are quickly becoming a core feature in the JavaScript ecosystem, with
the potential to unify how we manage state and reactivity across various
libraries and frameworks. By adopting `@lit-labs/signals`, you can start
experimenting with this cutting-edge technology today, and we can’t wait to see
what you’ll build with it.

## What Are Signals?

In simple terms, **signals** are observable data structures that hold values or
computations. When the value of a signal changes, all components or parts of
your app that depend on it are automatically notified and updated. This is
particularly useful in UIs where multiple components might need to share and
react to changes in state.

### Key Benefits of Signals

1. **Shared observable state**: Signals are great for managing state shared
   across multiple components. If one component updates a signal, all others
   using it will automatically update as well.
2. **Pinpoint updates**: Signals enable very targeted DOM updates, potentially
   improving performance by only updating the parts of the UI that need to
   change, rather than triggering a full component re-render.
3. **Interoperability**: The standardization of signals means different
   libraries and frameworks can use signals interoperably, reducing the need for
   complex adapters and improving compatibility.

## Why We're Excited About @lit-labs/signals

Lit is already known for its lightweight, performant, and declarative approach
to building web components. With `@lit-labs/signals`, we’re taking this to the
next level by tightly integrating signals into Lit’s lifecycle.

Lit's reactivity is by default relatively _shallow_. Components automatically
update when their reactive properties change, but not when nested properties
change. Responding to deep property changes has either required manual update
requests, or the integration of a state management system like Redux or MobX.

Signals give us many of the same deep observability abilities as these state
management systems, but with a smaller, simpler API, and the potential to be a
common standard across a large ecosystem of utilies, components, and frameworks.

The new `@lit-labs/signals` makes it super easy to use signals from within Lit
components.

Let’s dive into a few examples...

### Example 1: A Shared Counter

Here’s a simple example of a shared counter using `@lit-labs/signals`. When the
counter value changes, all components using it will automatically update:

```ts
import {LitElement, html} from 'lit';
import {customElement} from 'lit/decorators.js';
import {SignalWatcher, signal} from '@lit-labs/signals';

// This is a standard TC39 signal that uses the signals polyfill.
// The signal is shared across all component instances.
const count = signal(0);

@customElement('shared-counter')
export class SharedCounterComponent extends SignalWatcher(LitElement) {
  render() {
    // Just by using the signal in your template, your component will update
    // when the signal changes.
    return html`
      <p>The count is ${count.get()}</p>
      <button @click=${this.increment}>Increment</button>
    `;
  }

  increment() {
    count.set(count.get() + 1);
  }
}
```

With this approach, any number of `<shared-counter>` components can be added to
the DOM, and all will reflect the same counter value, automatically updating
when the signal changes.

### Example 2: Pinpoint DOM Updates

Using signals, you can also achieve more **pinpoint updates**—meaning only the
parts of the DOM bound to a signal will be updated, rather than re-rendering the
entire component.

```ts
import {LitElement, html} from 'lit';
import {customElement} from 'lit/decorators.js';
import {SignalWatcher, watch, signal} from '@lit-labs/signals';

const count = signal(0);

@customElement('pinpoint-counter')
export class PinpointCounter extends SignalWatcher(LitElement) {
  render() {
    return html`
      <p>The count is ${watch(count)}</p>
      <button @click=${this.increment}>Increment</button>
    `;
  }

  increment() {
    count.set(count.get() + 1);
  }
}
```

Here, only the text displaying the count is updated when the signal changes,
skipping unnecessary re-rendering and improving performance.

## Future Work

This is just the beginning or our exploration with signals integration for Lit.
Coming up soon we will add more utilities to the `@lit-labs/signals` for
incrementally rendering changes from collections, easily running side-effects in
components, and using signals for reactive properties.

Over time, as signals become standardized and we gain experience with using them
in Lit, signals will likely become part of the core library.

The Lit team is working closely with the TC39 Signals Proposal champions to
ensure that they work work great for Lit, web components, and plain DOM use
cases. We can't overstate how much potential we see in signals to form an
interoperable reactivity primitive that works across libraries and components
without requiring a centralized framework.

## Try It Out and Give Feedback

We’re eager to get feedback from the community as you experiment with this new
package. As part of the **Lit Labs** family, `@lit-labs/signals` is still
experimental and may undergo significant changes based on user feedback and
advancements in the TC39 Signals Proposal.

To get started, simply install the package:

```sh
npm i @lit-labs/signals
```

We’d love to hear your thoughts, so please try it out, and let us know how it
works for you.
