We've just launched a brand new [Lit Discord server](/discord/), and we'd love
for you to [join it now](/discord/)! Everybody is welcome, whether you are brand
new to Lit, or an experienced user.

We think the Lit Discord will be the best place to chat with the Lit community,
talk to the Lit dev team, get help using Lit, and show off your Lit projects! We
also plan to host special events there, using both chat and voice!

## Why Discord?

Here's what we like best about Discord:

1. **It's easy to be in *many* communities**, becuase you can quickly switch
   between them.

   There are already Discords for Modern Web, Shoelace, Vaadin, Material, Astro,
   and many other open source projects, so we think it will be great to be able
   to easily jump between them, share announcements, and more.

2. **Syntax highlighting**, including for nested html tagged template literals!

3. **Traction & growth**. Discord has had huge growth in recent years, and new
   open source projects seem to be choosing Discord more often than not now. We
   think that's becuase using Discord is a great experience, and because the
   friction to joining new Discord servers is low after you've started using it.

## What's happening to Slack?

The *Lit & Friends* workspace on Slack will be going into read-only mode on
**Tuesday, September 13, 2022**. After that, you'll be able to read existing
messages, but won't be able to post new ones. We've already sent a message to
every channel about these plans.

We decided to retire the Slack instead of maintaining both because we want to
encourage more communication and less silos. Slack has served the Lit community
well, but we think now is the right time to move to Discord!
