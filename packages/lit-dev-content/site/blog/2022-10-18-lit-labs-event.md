The Lit team is hosting a virtual event on **{{eventDate}}** to talk about all of the exciting work going on in Lit Labs.

And we'll let you know how you can help get these packages across the finish line and shape the future of Lit!

## What is Lit Labs?

[Lit Labs]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/libraries/labs/) is an umbrella for Lit packages under development that we are actively seeking community engagement on. These projects may be experimental or incomplete, or simply looking for real-world feedback. Lit Labs projects are published under the [`@lit-labs` npm scope](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40lit-labs).

## What will be covered at the Lit Labs event?

We'll show you how individual Labs packages can help you in your Web Component projects, and let you know what each package needs to graduate from Labs. Here are the packages we'll be covering:

- [Task](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/task)
- [Virtualizer](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/virtualizer)
- [Motion](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/motion)
- [Context](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/context)
- [React](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/react)

- [SSR](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/ssr)
