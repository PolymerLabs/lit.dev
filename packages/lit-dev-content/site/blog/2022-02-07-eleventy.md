The Lit team is pleased to announce an experimental preview release of
[`@lit-labs/eleventy-plugin-lit`](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/eleventy-plugin-lit),
a new plugin for [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) that renders your Lit
components as static HTML during your Eleventy build, and lets you hydrate them
after your JavaScript loads.

<aside class="warning">

As with all Lit Labs projects, this release should be considered experimental
and incomplete. We'd love for you to try it out and leave feedback, but expect
to find a few rough edges.

Check out the <a
href="https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/eleventy-plugin-lit">roadmap</a>
for a list of issues and missing features we're still working on.

Check it out now on
[GitHub](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/eleventy-plugin-lit)
and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/eleventy-plugin-lit), or read
on to learn more about what it does, why you might want to use it, and how it
works.

## What does it do?

After you've added `@lit-labs/eleventy-plugin-lit` to your Eleventy config, then
whenever you write a custom element tag in a markdown or HTML file, the initial
state of that component's shadow DOM and styles will be rendered directly into
the static HTML.

For example, given a markdown file `hello.md`:

```html
# Greetings

<demo-greeter name="World"></demo-greeter>
```

And a component definition `js/demo-greeter.js`:

```js
import {LitElement, html, css} from 'lit';

class DemoGreeter extends LitElement {
  static styles = css`
    b { color: red; }
  `;

  static properties = {
    name: {},
  };

  render() {
    return html`Hello <b>${this.name}</b>!`;
  }
}
customElements.define('demo-greeter', DemoGreeter);
```

Then Eleventy will produce an HTML file `hello/index.html` like this:

```html
<h1>Greetings</h1>

<demo-greeter name="World">
  <template shadowroot="open">
    <style>
      b { color: red; }
    </style>
    Hello <b>World</b>!
  </template>
</demo-greeter>
```

This HTML allows the browser to paint the initial state of the component's DOM
and styles, preserving all of the encapsulation boundaries of web components,
even before a single line of JavaScript has downloaded!

Later, when the JavaScript definition of `<demo-greeter>` has finally loaded,
the statically rendered component is upgraded to its fully interactive
JavaScript implementation through a process called *hydration*.

## Why should I use it?

Statically rendering components can be an effective method for reducing the time
it takes between a page starting to load, and the content becoming visible. This
is an important consideration that contributes to the responsiveness of your
site, particularly for users with slower connections and devices.

By transmitting the initial state of your components as static HTML, the browser
is able to paint the initial view much faster than it takes to download, parse,
and evaluate the JavaScript implementations of those components.

on the
Web](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web)*,

*[Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/lcp/)*.

## How does it work?

### Lit Labs SSR

The plugin uses `@lit-labs/ssr` under the hood, which works by creating an
instance of each component in a lightweight browser-like environment within the
Eleventy Node process, and evaluating the element's template using a special
version of Lit's `render` function. This special `render` function behaves much
like the `render` function that Lit uses in the browser, except that it emits a
stream of strings instead of writing to the DOM, allowing it to be efficiently
written out as static HTML.

For more information about `@lit-labs/ssr`, check out its [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/ssr). We'll be
expanding the documentation soon to help developers integrate `@lit-labs/ssr`
into more tools and frameworks!

### Declarative Shadow DOM

When `@lit-labs/ssr` renders a component, it uses `<template shadowroot>` HTML
elements to represent the component's shadow DOM and styles. When the browser
HTML parser encounters a `<template shadowroot>`, it applies that template's
content as the shadow root of its parent element. This way, all of the DOM and
style encapsulation guarantees of web components are preserved.

As of February 2022, Chrome and Edge have native support for Declarative Shadow
DOM, but Firefox and Safari have not yet implemented it. A very small polyfill
is available for browsers that don't yet have support. Integrating the polyfill
into your site is
[documented](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/eleventy-plugin-lit#polyfill)
in the `@lit-labs/eleventy-plugin-lit` README.

Shadow DOM](https://web.dev/declarative-shadow-dom/)*.

### Hydration

While static rendering lets your components' initial paint happen as quickly as
possible, the components won't yet be interactive, because their JavaScript
implementations haven't loaded.

*Hydration* is the process where a statically rendered component is upgraded to
its JavaScript implementation, becoming responsive and interactive.

Lit comes with automatic support for hydration via the special
`@lit-labs/ssr-client/lit-element-hydrate-support.js` module. As long as this module has been
loaded, Lit components will detect when they have been statically rendered, and
will adopt their existing shadow root.

Hydration with Lit is very efficient, because Lit knows that it doesn't need to
re-render the existing shadow root when it upgrades. If data changes after
hydration, then only the parts of the shadow root that changed will be updated.
