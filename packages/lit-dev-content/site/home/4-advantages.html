      <p>Lit is delightfully simple</p>
      <p>
        Building on top of the Web Components standards, Lit adds just what you
        need to be happy and productive: reactivity, declarative templates and
        a handful of thoughtful features to reduce boilerplate and make your job
        easier.

        <h2>Fast</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Lit is lightning-fast</p>
      <p>
        Weighing in at under 5 KB (minified and compressed), Lit helps keep
        your bundle size small and your loading time short. And rendering is
        lightning-fast, because Lit touches only the dynamic parts of your UI
        when updating–no need to rebuild a virtual tree and diff it with the DOM.

      <div class="heading">

        <h2>Lit is future-ready</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        By embracing the browser’s native component model, Lit minimizes
        lock-in, maximizes flexibility and promotes maintainability at scale.
        You can update to a major new version of Lit or migrate to another
        Web Components library one component at a time, without disrupting
        product development.

        <h2>Interoperable</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Lit is interoperable by design</p>
      <p>
        Lit components work in any front-end stack, because they're standard
        web components. And this is no accident: we've been actively involved
        in standards work from day one, and every Lit feature is carefully
        designed with platform evolution in mind.
