    <h3>Lit is delightfully simple</h3>
    <p>
      Building on top of the Web Components standards, Lit adds just what you
      need to be happy and productive: reactivity, declarative templates and
      a handful of thoughtful features to reduce boilerplate and make your job
      easier.

    <h3>Lit is lightning-fast</h3>
    <p>
      Weighing in at under 5 KB (minified and compressed), Lit helps keep
      your bundle size small and your loading time short. And rendering is
      lightning-fast, because Lit touches only the dynamic parts of your UI
      when updating–no need to rebuild a virtual tree and diff it with the DOM.

    <h3>Lit is future-ready</h3>
    <p>
      By embracing the browser’s native component model, Lit minimizes
      lock-in, maximizes flexibility and promotes maintainability at scale.
      You can update to a major new version of Lit or migrate to another
      Web Components library one component at a time, without disrupting
      product development.

    <h3>Lit is interoperable by design</h3>
    <p>
      Lit components work in any front-end stack, because they're standard
      web components. And this is no accident: we've been actively involved
      in standards work from day one, and every Lit feature is carefully
      designed with platform evolution in mind.
