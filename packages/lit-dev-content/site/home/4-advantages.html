    <h3>Lit is lightning fast</h3>
    <p>
      Weighing in at just 5 kB (minified and compressed), Lit helps keep
      your bundle size small and your loading time short. And UI updates are
      lightning-fast, because Lit only re-renders the dynamic parts–no
      diffing required.

    <h3>Lit is standards based</h3>
    <p>
      You’re in good hands with Lit. We’ve been involved with Web Components
      from day one and remain actively engaged in standards work. Every Lit
      feature is carefully designed with platform evolution in mind, helping
      you take full advantage of the modern web.

    <h3>Lit is future-ready</h3>
    <p>
      By using the browser’s native component model, Lit minimizes lock-in
      and maximizes flexibility. You’ll be able to update to a major new
      version of Lit or migrate to another Web Components library one
      component at a time safely, without disrupting product development.
