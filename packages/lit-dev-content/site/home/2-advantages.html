      <p>Skip the boilerplate</p>
      <p>
        Building on top of the Web Components standards, Lit adds just what you
        need to be happy and productive: reactivity, declarative templates and
        a handful of thoughtful features to reduce boilerplate and make your job
        easier. Every Lit feature is carefully designed with web platform evolution
        in mind.

        <h1>Fast</h1>
      </div>
      <p>Tiny footprint, instant updates</p>
      <p>
        Weighing in at around 5 KB (minified and compressed), Lit helps keep
        your bundle size small and your loading time short. And rendering is
        blazing fast, because Lit touches only the dynamic parts of your UI
        when updating â€” no need to rebuild a virtual tree and diff it with the DOM.

      </div>
      <p>Interoperable &amp; future-ready</p>
      <p>
        Every Lit component is a native web component, with the superpower of
        interoperability. Web components work anywhere you use HTML, with any
        framework or none at all. This makes Lit ideal for building shareable
        components, design systems, or maintainable, future-ready sites and apps.
