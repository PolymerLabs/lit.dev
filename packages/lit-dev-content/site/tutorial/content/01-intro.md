This interactive tutorial will help you get started with Lit and see how simple it is to build fast, lightweight web components.

Each step of this tutorial introduces one or two Lit concepts.

If you get stuck on a step, click **Solve** to see the finished code, or click **Reset** to return to the starting code. You can try it out on this page.

For a primer on web components, or if you'd like a more traditional tutorial, check out our [codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/the-lit-path). You can also review our documentation for more information as you go along.
