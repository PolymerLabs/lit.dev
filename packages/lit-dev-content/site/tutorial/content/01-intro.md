Lit components are [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements), so they act like regular HTML elements. You can add them to a page with simple HTML tags, like this:

```html
<my-element></my-element>
```

You can see check out `index.html` in the code editor to see how the sample Lit component is added to the page.
