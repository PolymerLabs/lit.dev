This interactive tutorial will help you get started with Lit and see how simple it is to build fast, lightweight web components.

Each step of this tutorial introduces one or two Lit features. Use the interactive editor to add features to the starting code sample and preview the output.

If you get stuck on a step, click **Solve** to see the finished code, or click **Reset** to return to the starting code. The editor shows a basic Lit component like the ones you'll create in the subsequent steps. For now, just try out the **Solve** and **Reset** buttons.

Lit components are [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components), so they act like regular HTML elements. You can add them to a page with simple HTML tags, like this:

```html
<my-element></my-element>
```

Take a look at `index.html` in the code editor to see how the sample Lit component is added to the page.

 You can also review our documentation for more information as you go along.
