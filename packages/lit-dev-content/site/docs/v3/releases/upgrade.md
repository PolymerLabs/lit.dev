If you are looking to migrate from Lit 1.x to Lit 2.x, see the [Lit 2 upgrade guide](/docs/v2/releases/upgrade/).

</div>

## Overview

Lit 3.0 has very few breaking changes from Lit 2.x:

- IE11 is no longer supported.
- Lit's npm modules are now published as ES2021.
- APIs marked deprecated in Lit 2.x releases have been removed.
- SSR hydration support modules have moved to the `@lit-labs/ssr-client` package.
- Type only: Type of `ReactiveElement`'s `renderRoot` and `createRenderRoot()` have been updated.
- Decorator behavior has been unified between TypeScript experimental decorators and standard decorators.
- Support was removed for Babel decorators version "2018-09".

For the vast majority of users there should be no required code changes to upgrade from Lit 2 to Lit 3. Most apps and libraries should be able to extend their npm version ranges to include both 2.x and 3.x, like `"^2.7.0 || ^3.0.0"`.

Lit 2.x and 3.0 are _interoperable_ â€“ templates, base classes, and directives from one version of Lit will work with those from another.

## Lit is now published as ES2021

Lit 2 was published as ES2019, and Lit 3 is now published as ES2021 which has wide support in modern browsers and build tools.
This may be a breaking change if you need to support older browser versions and your current tooling can't parse ES2021.

### Using Lit 3 with Webpack 4

Webpack 4's internal parser doesn't support nullish coalescing (`??`), logical assignment (`??=`), or optional chaining (`?.`), which are syntaxes introduced in ES2021 so will throw a `Module parse failed: Unexpected token` when encountering those.

The preferred solution is to upgrade to Webpack 5 which does support parsing these newer JS syntax. However if you are unable to do so, it is possible to use `babel-loader` to transform Lit 3 code to work with Webpack 5.

To transpile Lit 3 in Webpack 4, install the following required babel packages:

```sh
> npm i -D babel-loader@8 \
    @babel/plugin-transform-optional-chaining \
    @babel/plugin-transform-nullish-coalescing-operator \
    @babel/plugin-transform-logical-assignment-operators
```

And add a new rule that is similar to the following (you may need to modify it based on your specific project):

```js
// In webpack.config.js

module.exports = {
  // ...

  module: {
    rules: [
      // ... your other rules

      // Add a babel-loader rule to downlevel Lit's ES2021 syntax so Webpack 4 can parse it.
      // TODO: Once on Webpack 5, this rule can be deleted.
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        include: ['@lit', 'lit-element', 'lit-html'].map((p) =>
          path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/' + p)
        ),
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            plugins: [
              '@babel/plugin-transform-optional-chaining',
              '@babel/plugin-transform-nullish-coalescing-operator',
              '@babel/plugin-transform-logical-assignment-operators'
            ],
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }
}
```

## Updates to Lit decorators


JavaScript decorators have recently been standardized by TC39 and are at Stage 3 of the four-stage standardization process. Stage 3 is when JavaScript implementations such as VMs and compilers start implementing the stable specification. TypeScript 5.2 and Babel 7.23 have implemented the standard recently.

This means that there is more than one version of the decorator API in existence: standard decorators, TypeScript's experimental decorators, and previous proposals that Babel has implemented, such as version "2018-09".

While Lit 2 supported TypeScript experimental decorators and Babel's "2018-09" decorators, Lit 3 now supports standard decorators and TypeScript experimental decorators.

The Lit 3 decorators are mostly backwards compatible with the Lit 2 TypeScript decorators - **most likely no changes are needed**.

Some minor breaking changes were necessary to make the Lit decorators behave consistently between both experimental and standard decorator modes.

Changes to Lit decorator behavior in Lit 3.0:

- `requestUpdate()` is called automatically for `@property()` and `@state()` decorated accessors where previously that was the setters responsibility.
- The value of an accessor is read on first render and used as the initial value for `changedProperties` and attribute reflection.
- Lit 3 decorators no longer support the `version: "2018-09"` option of `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators`. Babel users should [migrate to standard decorators](#standard-decorator-migration).
- [Optional]: [We recommend migrating `@property()` and `@state()` to the setter for hand-written accessors to aid in migrating to standard decorators.](#decorated-getter)

## List of removed APIs

If your Lit 2.x project does not have deprecation warnings you should not be
impacted by this list.

- [Removed `UpdatingElement` alias for `ReactiveElement`.](#removed-updating-element)
- [Removed re-export of decorators from main `lit-element` module.](#removed-re-export-decorators)
- [Removed deprecated call signature for the `queryAssignedNodes` decorator.](#removed-queryassignednodes-non-object)
- [Moved experimental server side rendering hydration modules from `lit`, `lit-element`, and `lit-html` to `@lit-labs/ssr-client`.](#moved-experimental-hydration)

## Steps to upgrade

### Removed `UpdatingElement` alias for `ReactiveElement` {#removed-updating-element}

Replace Lit 2.x usage of `UpdatingElement` with `ReactiveElement`. This is not a
functional change as `UpdatingElement` was aliasing `ReactiveElement`.

```ts
// Removed
import {UpdatingElement} from 'lit';

// Updated
import {ReactiveElement} from 'lit';
```

### Removed re-export of decorators from `lit-element` {#removed-re-export-decorators}

Lit 3.0 [built-in
decorators](/docs/v3/components/decorators/#built-in-decorators) are no longer
exported by `lit-element`, and should instead be imported from
`lit/decorators.js`.

```ts
// Removed decorator exports from lit-element
import {customElement, property, state} from 'lit-element';

// Updated
import {customElement, property, state} from 'lit/decorators.js';
```

### Deprecated `queryAssignedNodes(slot: string, flatten: bool, selector: string)` decorator signature removed {#removed-queryassignednodes-non-object}

Migrate any usage of `queryAssignedNodes` taking a selector to use `queryAssignedElements`.

```ts
// Removed
@queryAssignedNodes('list', true, '.item')

// Updated
@queryAssignedElements({slot: 'list', flatten: true, selector: '.item'})
```

Usages without a `selector` now must take an options object.

```ts
// Removed
@queryAssignedNodes('list', true)

// Updated
@queryAssignedNodes({slot: 'list', flatten: true})
```

### Server side rendering experimental hydration modules removed from `lit`, `lit-element`, and `lit-html` {#moved-experimental-hydration}

Experimental hydration support has been moved out of core libraries and into
[`@lit-labs/ssr-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/ssr-client).

```ts
// Removed
import 'lit/experimental-hydrate-support.js';
import {hydrate} from 'lit/experimental-hydrate.js';

// Updated
import '@lit-labs/ssr-client/lit-element-hydrate-support.js';
import {hydrate} from '@lit-labs/ssr-client';
```


## [Type only]: Type of `renderRoot` and `createRenderRoot()` have been updated {#render-root-type-update}

This is a type only change with no runtime effect.

The type of `ReactiveElement.renderRoot` was changed from `Element | ShadowRoot` to `HTMLElement | DocumentFragment` and the return type of `ReactiveElement.createRenderRoot()` was changed from `HTMLElement | ShadowRoot` to `HTMLElement | DocumentFragment`. This makes them congruent with each other, as well as lit-html's `render()`.

This change generally should not affect code that simply accesses `this.renderRoot`. However, any code that had explicit type annotations for their former types should be updated.

## Optional: Upgrade to standard decorators {#standard-decorator-migration}

While Lit 3 adds support for standard decorators, we still recommend that TypeScript users stay with experimental decorators. This is because the emitted code for standard decorators from the TypeScript and Babel compilers is quite large at the moment.

We will recommend standard decorators for production when browsers support them, or when we release decorator transform support in our new Lit compiler.

But you can try standard decorators now, and they work in TypeScript 5.2 and above and Babel 7.23 with the `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators` plugin.

### Configuration

#### TypeScript

Install TypeScript 5.2 or later, and _remove_ the `"experimentalDecorators"` setting from your tsconfig if it's present.

#### Babel

Install Babel 7.23 or later, and [`@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators`](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-plugin-proposal-decorators). Be sure to pass the `"version": "2023-05"` option to the plugin.

### Code changes

#### Add the `accessor` keyword to decorated fields {#add-accessor-to-decorated-fields}

Standard decorators are not allowed to change the _kind_ of class member they decorate. Decorators that need to create getters and setters must be applied to existing getters and setters. To make this more ergonomic, the decorators standard adds the `accessor` keyword which creates "auto accessors" when applied to a class field. Auto accessors look and act much like class fields, but create accessors on the prototype backed by private storage.

The `@property()`, `@state()`, `@query()`, `@queryAll()`, `@queryAssignedElements()` and `@queryAssignedNode()` decorators require the `accessor` keyword.

Example:

```ts
class MyElement extends LitElement {
  @property()
  accessor myProperty = "initial value"
...
}
```

#### Move decorators from getters to setters {#decorated-getter}

Standard decorators can only replace the class member they're directly applied to. Lit decorators need to intercept property setting, so the decorators must be applied to setters. This is different from the Lit 2 recommendation of applying decorators to getters.

For `@property()` and `@state()` you can also remove any `this.requestUpdate()` calls in the setter since this is done automatically now. If you need to _not_ have `requestUpdate()` called, you'll have to use the `noAccessor` property option.

Note that for `@property()` and `@state()` the _getter_ will be called by the decorator when setting the property to retrieve the old value. This means that you _must_ define both a getter and a setter.

Before:

```ts
class MyElement extends LitElement {
  private _foo = 42;
  set(v) {
    const oldValue = this._foo;
    this._foo = v;
    this.requestUpdate('foo', oldValue);
  }
  @property()
  get() {
    return this._foo;
  }
}
```

After:

```ts
class MyElement extends LitElement {
  private _foo = 42;
  @property()
  set(v) {
    this._foo = v;
  }
  get() {
    return this._foo;
  }
}
```
