There are many great resources and locations to learn about Lit,
share what you've built, and more. Participation in our community is subject to the Lit
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)—be
excellent to each other!

*   **Join us on [Slack](https://www.polymer-project.org/slack-invite)!** The
    Lit workspace has thousands of users discussing lit-html, LitElement, and related topics.
    Check out `#lit`, `#beginners`, or `#tools` to get started.

*   **Follow us at [@buildWithLit  on Twitter](https://twitter.com/buildWithLit)**
    for the latest on Lit and web components. Many
    of our team members can also be found tweeting about Lit,
    and the latest developments in the web platform.

*   **Find answers on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/lit+or+lit-html+or+lit-element).**
    Search the [`lit`, `lit-element`, and `lit-html`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/lit+or+lit-html+or+lit-element) tags when
    looking for answers. You can also find help on underlying web standards with
    tags like [`web-component`](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/web-component),
    and try your hand at answering other people’s queries.
