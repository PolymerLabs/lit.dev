Add a template to your component to define what it should render. Templates can include _expressions_, which are placeholders for dynamic content.

To define a template for a Lit component, add a `render()` method:

{% playground-example "docs/templates/define" "my-element.ts" %}

Write your template in HTML inside a JavaScript [tagged template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates) using Lit's `html` tag function.

Lit templates can include JavaScript _expressions_. You can use expressions to set text content, attributes, properties, and event listeners. The `render()` method can also include any JavaScriptâ€”for example, you can create local variables for use in expressions.

Typically, the component's `render()` method returns a single `TemplateResult` object (the same type returned by the `html` tag function). However, it can return anything that Lit can render:

*   Primitive values like string, number, or boolean.
*   `TemplateResult` objects created by the `html` function.
*   DOM Nodes.
*   Arrays or iterables of any of the supported types.

For more information about writing templates, see [Templates](/docs/templates/overview/).

## Writing a good render() method

To take best advantage of Lit's functional rendering model, follow these guidelines for implementing your `render()` method:

* Does not change the component's state.
* Does not have any side effects.
* Only depends on the component's properties.
* Returns the same result when given the same property values.

Following these guidelines keeps the template deterministic, and makes it easier to reason about the code.

In most cases you should avoid making DOM updates outside of `render()`. Instead, express the component's template as a function of its state, and capture its state in properties.

For example, if your component needs to update its UI when it receives an event, have the event listener set a reactive property that is used in `render()`, rather than manipulate the DOM directly.

For more information, see [Reactive properties](/docs/components/properties/).

## Composing templates

You can compose Lit templates from other templates. The following example composes a template for a component called `<my-page>` from smaller templates for the page's header, footer, and main content:

{% playground-example "docs/templates/compose" "my-page.ts" %}

In this example, the individual templates are defined as instance methods, so a subclass could extend this component and override one or more templates.

{% todo %}

Move example to composition section, add xref.

{% endtodo %}

You can also compose templates by importing other elements and using them in your template:

{% playground-ide "docs/templates/composeimports" %}


## When templates render

A Lit component renders its template initially when it's added to the DOM on a page. After the initial render, any change to the component's reactive properties triggers an update cycle, re-rendering the component.

Lit batches updates to maximize performance and efficiency. Setting multiple properties at once triggers only one update, performed asynchronously at microtask timing.

During an update, only the parts of the DOM that change are re-rendered. Although Lit templates look like string interpolation, Lit parses and creates static HTML once, and then only updates changed values in expressions after that, making updates very efficient.

For more information about the update cycle, see [What happens when properties change](/docs/components/properties/#update-cycle).

## DOM encapsulation

Lit uses shadow DOM to encapsulate the DOM a component renders. Shadow DOM provides three benefits:

* DOM scoping. DOM APIs like `document.querySelector` won't find elements in the
  component's shadow DOM, so it's harder for global scripts to accidentally break your component.
* Style scoping. You can write encapsulated styles for your shadow DOM that don't
  affect the rest of the  page. No need for conventions like BEM to associate styles with your component.
* Composition. The component's shadow DOM (managed by the component) is separate from the component's children. You can choose how children are rendered in your templated DOM.

For more information about shadow DOM, see [Shadow DOM v1: Self-Contained Web Components
](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/shadowdom) on Web Fundamentals.

For more information about working with shadow DOM in your component, see [Working with shadow DOM](/docs/components/shadow-dom/).
