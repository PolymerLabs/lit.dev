  Lit labs packages are published to get feedback from the wider community. This code shouldn't be used in production, but we encourage you to try it out and [file issues](https://github.com/lit/lit/issues/new/choose) for any bugs you find. For general feedback, please use the GitHub [discussion](https://github.com/lit/lit/discussions).

For more information about the Lit labs process, see [Lib Labs](/docs/libraries/labs/)

The `@lit-labs/testing` package contains utility functions that utilize a Web Test Runner plugin to create test fixtures that are rendered server-side using `@lit-labs/ssr`. It can help test whether your components are server-side renderable. See more in the [readme](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/testing#readme).
