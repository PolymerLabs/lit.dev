  Lit labs packages are published to get feedback from the wider community. This code shouldn't be used in production, but we encourage you to try it out and [file issues](https://github.com/lit/lit/issues/new/choose) for any bugs you find. For general feedback, please use the GitHub [discussion](https://github.com/lit/lit/discussions).

Lit SSR generates static HTML for the browser to parse and paint without any JavaScript. (Browsers that do not have support for Declarative Shadow DOM will require some JavaScript polyfill for Lit Elements authored to utilize the Shadow DOM.) For pages with static content, this is all that's needed. However, if the page content needs to be dynamic and respond to user interactions, it will need JavaScript to re-apply that reactivity.

"Hydration" is the process having Lit re-associate the expressions of a Lit template with the  nodes they should update in the DOM, as well as adding reactivity and life cycles to Lit elements.

How to hydrate client-side depends on whether you are rendering standalone Lit templates or utilizing Lit elements.

## Standalone Lit Templates
In order to hydrate Lit templates, the `hydrate` method from the `experimental-hydrate` module is provided in the `lit` package. Prior to updating a server-rendered container using `render`, you should first call `hydrate` on that container using the same template and data that was used to render on the server:

```js
import {render} from 'lit';
import {hydrate} from 'lit/experimental-hydrate.js';
import {myTemplate} from './my-template.js';
// Initial hydration required before render:
// (must be same data used to render on the server)
const initialData = getInitialAppData();
hydrate(myTemplate(initialData), document.body);

// After hydration, render will efficiently update the server-rendered DOM:
const update = (data) => render(myTemplate(data), document.body);
```

## Lit elements
When LitElements are server rendered, their shadow root contents are emitted inside a `<template shadowroot>`, also known as a [Declarative Shadow Root](https://web.dev/declarative-shadow-dom/), a new browser feature that is shipping in [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-chrome-90/#declarative). Declarative shadow roots automatically attach their contents to a shadow root on the template's parent element when parsed. For browsers that do not yet implement declarative shadow root, there is a [`template-shadowroot` polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/template-shadowroot), described below.

Because the `hydrate` function above does not descend into shadow roots, it only works on one scope of the DOM at a time. To hydrate `LitElement` shadow roots, load the `lit/experimental-hydrate-support.js` module, which installs support for `LitElement` automatically hydrating itself when it detects it was server-rendered with declarative shadow DOM. This module should be loaded before the `lit` module is loaded, to ensure hydration support is properly installed.

Put together, an HTML page that was server rendered and containing LitElements in the main document might look like this:

```js
import {render} from '@lit-labs/ssr/lib/render-with-global-dom-shim.js';
import './app-components.js';

app.use(async (ctx) => {
  const ssrResult = render(html`
    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
      <body>
        <app-shell>
          <app-page-one></app-page-one>
          <app-page-two></app-page-two>
        </app-shell>

        <script type="module">
          // Hydrate template-shadowroots eagerly after rendering (for browsers without
          // native declarative shadow roots)
          import {
            hasNativeDeclarativeShadowRoots,
            hydrateShadowRoots
          } from './node_modules/@webcomponents/template-shadowroot/template-shadowroot.js';
          if (!hasNativeDeclarativeShadowRoots) {
            hydrateShadowRoots(document.body);
          }
          // ...
          // Load and hydrate components lazily
          import('./app-components.js');
        </script>

      </body>
    </html>
  `);
  ctx.type = 'text/html';
  ctx.body = Readable.from(ssrResult);
});
```

Note that as a simple example, the code above assumes a static top-level template that does not need to be hydrated on the client, and that top-level components individually hydrate themselves using data supplied either by attributes or via a side-channel mechanism. This is in no way fundamental; the top-level template can be used to pass data to the top-level components, and that template can be loaded and hydrated on the client to apply the same data.
