LitElement is a simple base class for creating fast, lightweight web components that work in any web page with any framework.

LitElement uses [lit-html](/docs/v1/lit-html/introduction/) to render into shadow DOM, and adds API to manage properties and attributes. Properties are observed by default, and elements update asynchronously when their properties change.

## Next steps

* [Getting Started](/docs/v1/getting-started/): Set up LitElement and create a component.
* [Templates](/docs/v1/components/templates/): Write templates with lit-html syntax.
* [Properties](/docs/v1/components/properties/): Manage properties and attributes.
* [Lifecycle](/docs/v1/components/lifecycle/): Work with the LitElement lifecycle API.
